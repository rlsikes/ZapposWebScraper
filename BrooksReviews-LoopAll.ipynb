Fit is great and everything else is fine with the shoe, but will return because of the color.\\r\\n', 'great quality, versatile. I wear them when I travel for work, then swap with a pair of black pumps or flats for my client meetings.\\r\\n', \"Great shoe with great arch support. These are wonderful if you're on your feet all day.\\r\\n\", 'I’ve worn Nike Air Pegasus since I started running 30 years ago. They are still the best. I have narrow feet and these are one of the few shoes that are made in a narrow width. Although I wear an 8 in a street shoe, I wear a 10 in a running shoe. When you’re running marathons, you need room for your feet to expand.\\r\\n', 'My wife loved these running sneakers, very comfortable and stylish\\r\\n', 'So glad I purchased. Pleasantly surprised that back and knee pain has significantly reduced since I started wearing these shoes.\\r\\n', 'Ordered a number of different style Nike sneakers but loved these as soon as I put them on. This style felt the most \"substantial\", for lack of a better word. Some of the other styles were not as \"solid\" and I could press down the back of the sneaker as I put them on. These are sturdy yet light weight. Very comfortable fit.\\r\\n', 'Love iy\\r\\n', 'Very comfortable and true to size. I use them for exercise classes and they are great!\\r\\n', 'Perfect shoes!! I wear these all day every day. Bought the white ones to go with everything.\\r\\n', 'Love this shoe. Wear all day comfort\\r\\n', \"I'm an 8 with my other Nike sneakers, but this 8 felt pretty tight. I had to size up to 8.5. Other than that they look and feel great.\\r\\n\", 'Love love these sneakers only thing is they do definitely run small. I work in a hospital and sometimes work 12hour shifts very comfortable for being on my feet that long!\\r\\n', \"They felt comfortable the first time wearing them. I recently started running and was having ankle/foot pain. I only recently realized that high arches want neutral shoes and more cushion, so I got these. They've been great and my feet are much happier. I wish running shoes didn't have to all be so bright and so many colors. These are more subtle than most, yet I still wish they were more subdued - I might wear them more in my daily life if they were. Still, I'm happy with them.\\r\\n\", \"This is one of only two Nike runners available in wide. It's an all-day delight, and found fans in my book club when I wore them there yesterday. I thought the colors were garish, but the ladies loved them, and, I guess, my pants are always solid-colored, so the shoes brought smiles. But I wear them for their great comfort. I sure wish Zappos carried more colors in the Air Zoom Pegasus wide!\\r\\n\", 'Very comfy but run a little narrow\\r\\n', 'REally liked...but it was quite purply!\\r\\n', 'It ran a half size larger than my previous pair.\\r\\n', 'I WANTED to LOVE these .. they looked great , however the were so tight across the top of my foot that even after loosening the laces ... my foot was numb after just a short test run in the house . I had to return them . Perhaps ordering the WIDE would help but I am not sure what would solve the fit issue on these for me.\\r\\n', \"I own a pair of these, as of 3 days ago. Still debating to keep or send back, due to the tight fit. As others have said , this model Nike seems to be narrow, compared to most Nike's in the past, I've owned that were always true to size for me.\\r\\nThey look nice, but sizing is the issue for me on this shoe. I'd go a half size larger, on length, and next width up if I exchange. '\\r\\n\", \"Unfortunately these sneakers were too big for me so I had to return them. zappos didn't have it in a size 10 when I went to order them.\\r\\nI did purchase these someplace else and am satisfied with the sneakers. These are pretty lightweight. I bought a wide size and added inserts for extra support. I use it for Zumba and Tabata classes.\\r\\n\", 'The shoes are lovely but do not fit like my previous Nike. I tried to buy the same style exactly. I found this toe bed one half inch more narrow. Sadly, they are being returned. Love Zappos service!\\r\\n', 'The shoe is comfortable but lacks a bit in lateral stability. Also , the description says black and the teim is black but the body is navy blue.\\r\\n', \"So I love the style of this sneaker, but I struggled with finding the right size. My regular shoe size seemed too big and the half size smaller felt kind of snug and narrow. I debated which size to go for and ended up with the smaller size and luckily they have stretched a little bit and now feel comfortable, so for me it did require a break in period. I'm also used to wearing the Nike Free RN and it's much wider, softer and more flexible and it fit comfortably right out of the box. This sneaker took some getting used to but it also provides a lot more support than the Free Rn. My arches tend to roll in slightly and this sneaker helped to support my arch better and prevents it from rolling in unlike the Free RN. If you're looking for something that's very supportive and durable I'd go for these. \", \"It's a nice looking and light weight shoe but just not a comfortable shoe.

      "{'shoe': 'Nike Air Zoom Wildhorse 4 ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': ['The shoe that made 18mi backpacking days possible for me. I’m in love.\\r\\n', \"I am 5'9 & 130lbs and a true size 9. I Underpronate (supinate) severely on my right leg and pretty Neutral on my left. I run about 50 to 60 road miles per week with at least two 10 milers in there. So i like my shoe comfy and i like my runs amazing! I bought these sneakers in a size 9.5 since it’s winter and winter socks are in order. However, even though i sized up for winter I’ve noticed my “Splaying” runner’s toes actually require a 9.5 in all sneakers every run season, and it feels better this way. Back to the Wildhorse4. These are true to its name. It’s like a horse for real. Stable, Solid & Sturdy. They do not require breaking-in as much as they require getting used too. The fit of trail sneakers are very different from regular running sneakers and I got these to run snow, ice and rain days this winter. They are hard and hugs your mid-foot securely!!! No ankle rolling here and a FOR SURE guided forefoot landing! There is a form-fitting-semi-Stretch band that goes across the forefoot and mid-foot (bright Orange on my sneaks) that made these sneakers hard to get into, but within the 1st mile I understand it. This is that Secure-fit & Stability in action. These felt true to size. But size up if you will be wearing winter warm running socks. Overall i love the Wildhorse4. I have to get used to the tight instep, but the toe box is wide enough for swelling during runs. The run is not smooth and light, but rather STURDY and SECURE. It’s a must have for runs on those trail days, snow days, slushy ice and rain days. Great addition to the runner’s stable!\\r\\n\", \"More cushioning under the heel than the average shoe, and much lighter than most trail running shoes. Minimal drop too (I think 4mm) makes it so you can still have contact with the ground but the cushioning still provides great support. A little hot since they are form fitting around the midfoot. Not a prob if you're running in cooler weather!\\r\\n\", \"Great trail running or hiking shoes. Not too heavy, but offer enough support. They are also cute colors - not too bright. The light blue does show dirt pretty well, but then you look tough. I'm an8.5 in regular shoes, so bought a 9, but may go up a size on my next pair as my feet swell when I jog and these always feel tight after an hour.\\r\\nOne complaint - the laces are a little thin and short, so if I did need to tighten them more, there would barely be room to tie them.\\r\\n\", \"Not loving the updated Wildhorse as much as the previous models. Too stiff/ padded around the collar putting extra pressure around that part of my foot below ankles. I wouldn't have needed to order up a half size as I did with previous versions either. Kind of wish I had just bought Wildhorse 3 before model runs out, but now stuck with these.\\r\\n\", 'Lacing system bot as good as Wildhprse 3, makes shoes crinkles and look much older.\\r\\nAround the abkle the wildhorse 4 has a sharp piece and hurts my ankle bone. I will be returning these as flawed!\\r\\nI miss the Wildhorse 3!\\r\\n', 'I LOVE these shoes!!! They are an awesome trail running shoe, I was able to take them straight out of the box and go for a run no “break in” time!!! I have a wide foot and these feel great. I’m going to order another pair!!!\\r\\n', \"To help me decide if it's the right shoe, I like to wear new shoes for a day around my house doing various activities. I fell in love with this shoe until toward the end of the day I started getting a pain to the outside of my right ankle every time I walked? It was the cut of the shoe that was digging into my ankle right on the bone that did it in. Have to send them back, I'm SO disappointed they didn't work out - otherwise they are an awesome fit!\\r\\n\", 'I have always bought Nikes in the same size and these fit as expected. they are firm around my arch which is very comfortable. There is no pain at all from any part of the shoe including the ankle area. I run on all-terrain including downhill, and these cushion a large amount of impact. They also keep sand out as long as you tighten them enough. I am very impressed by these shoes. I am transitioning from minimalist shoes and the amount of padding takes getting used to along with this being a much heavier shoe. I wish I could have them in some of the other colors as well.\\r\\n', 'Runs very small definitely order at least a half size up. Other then that a great running shoe\\r\\n', 'Great very grippy trail running/hiking shoe.\\r\\n', \"I have worn Nike trail running shoes for over 10 years, size 9.5 fits me perfect everytime. These shoes are triple cute, but unfortunately, the solid yellow band that goes across the top of the shoe makes it a no go for my high arches/tall foot. The yellow band that goes across the top made it very tight and uncomfortable on the top of my foot so had to return. Nike's trail options are so limited right now.

They have great support and I love the whole look of them! They are sporty yet unique, so I don't have to worry about anyone having the same shoes that I have and they are very reasonable! I wear a size 11-11 1/2 which is very big considering I am only a freshmen in high school, and my biggest struggle is finding shoes that don't make my feet look massive! These shoes actually make my feet appear normal/small which for girls with large feet is definitely a plus!\", \"These are so soft and comfortable. They feel like slippers! I wouldn't do anything too strenuous in them, unless you want a sprained ankle, because they don't provide enough support, but they are great for running errands!\", \"These are the perfect fit for me, I'm often between a 10.5 and 11, ordered these in a 10.5 and they fit really well, and stretched out just a bit where I needed it in the toes.

I was concerned after reading the review, but I'm not really sure about the other reviewer saying it has unfinished edges and doesn't have padding. I specifically looked inside the shoe before I gave them to my wife just to make sure they were ok, and I thought they had a good amount of padding. I didn't see anything rough or coarse - it's almost like a slipper/sock the way that it's made - plus no complaints from my wife either. I'm actually a little jealous this is only offered in women's.

They have great support and I love the whole look of them! They are sporty yet unique, so I don't have to worry about anyone having the same shoes that I have and they are very reasonable! I wear a size 11-11 1/2 which is very big considering I am only a freshmen in high school, and my biggest struggle is finding shoes that don't make my feet look massive! These shoes actually make my feet appear normal/small which for girls with large feet is definitely a plus!\", \"These are so soft and comfortable. They feel like slippers! I wouldn't do anything too strenuous in them, unless you want a sprained ankle, because they don't provide enough support, but they are great for running errands!\", \"These are the perfect fit for me, I'm often between a 10.5 and 11, ordered these in a 10.5 and they fit really well, and stretched out just a bit where I needed it in the toes. They provide a lot of cushion in the insoles and some arch support--I could use more, but it seems to be in the moderate range. Even though they have a lot of support, they are still very light. \", \"Crack for your feet! These are the lightest, softest, most amazing sneakers I've ever worn. That said, if you're looking for arch support, lateral stability etc., forget it, these are just good shoes for knocking about in. Cute to boot. The 8 fits snugly on my 7.5-8C foot. Oh! And you can wear them barefoot with no smell. Amazing, Saucony!\", 'Seriously these are the most comfortable shoes ever! I see that someone commented that they are not great for running. Maybe not, but they feel just perfect to me for walking around all day. They are super light weight and almost make it feel like you are not wearing shoes. Though supportive enough you know you must be wearing shoes.', \"My wife loves Saucony's so I picked up a pair of these (the polka dot version) to surprise her and she can't stop raving about them! She loves how lightweight and comfortable they are. They have this really soft memory foam piece which she says feels like a pillow under her foot. I was concerned after reading the review, but I'm not really sure about the other reviewer saying it has unfinished edges and doesn't have padding. I specifically looked inside the shoe before I gave them to my wife just to make sure they were ok, and I thought they had a good amount of padding. I didn't see anything rough or coarse - it's almost like a slipper/sock the way that it's made - plus no complaints from my wife either. I'm actually a little jealous this is only offered in women's. Can't ever say enough about how awesome Zappos is - super easy ordering and it's unreal how fast the shipping is!\", \"Ordered this as a running shoe for my daughter, but it doesn't have enough support. It's more of a style shoe. Will be returning!\", \"Very comfortable and nice looking too. I'm ordering this shoe again in a different color\\r\\n\", 'These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on! They are lightweight and very flexible. The soles feel like clouds.\\r\\n', \"I bought a pair of Nike's running shoe first, they were ok but the top part of the shoe kept hurting my feet, i untied the shoe strings to give room but as soon as i tied my shoe, it kept giving me problems, it actually bruised the top of my right foot so i ordered these pair and went a size up...These shoes are so comfortable with the memory foam and all...I stand on my feet 8 hrs a day so these are Perfect...i will be buying these again!!!\\r\\n\", \"These sneakers, like all Saucony sneakers on me, are super comfortable - the most comfortable sneaker brand I've ever owned! This style is light & feels like slippers! They're stylish & in fashion. I am usually a size 71/2 in Saucony & all other brands of sneakers & shoes. But I had to go up half a size in these to an 8 - so I recommend ordering 1 half size up from your usual.\\r\\n\", 'I am on my feet 7 hours a day working at a very busy medical office and these ARE WONDERFUL! I did have to order a half size larger than usual but Zappos was awesome about sending the correct size BEFORE I even sent back the first pair! I have had them for a little over two weeks now and will be buying another pair strictly for every day wear as I like to have a separate pair for work since I log so many steps a day while there.\\r\\n', 'Extremely comfortable shoe! They also came with blue laces. Really recommend buying these, just bought my second pair! ?? I’m normally a size 7 1/2 but they were a bit tight the first time I bought them so this time i ordered a size 8 and they fit perfect!\\r\\n', 'Love this shoe. Super comfy .\\r\\n', \"I love these! They are super comfortable and easy to take off and on without untying. I have a pretty wide foot, and these didn't come in wide so I tried the regular, and they feel fine. No rubbing or hot spots. I wore them for over 10 hours and did several miles of walking through the city and at the end of the day they still felt great.\\r\\n\", 'Oh My. I have never taken a shoe out of the box and had it feel comfortable. These shoes are the best for fit. They form fit the foot like a glove. Very lightweight but has support. I am buying another pair.\\r\\n', 'I? love these shoes! This is my second pair. They are both extremely comfortable and stylish. I? wear these for walking as well as many fitness classes, including running on the treadmill. I? highly recommend these if you don’t need too much support for your feet and want a very lightweight shoe.\\r\\n', 'Love these for running around! So cute and comfortable.\\r\\n', 'No removable inserts, so I had to send them back. Too bad.\\r\\n', 'Love these sneakers! They are cute with jeans and leggings, definitely pair with some no-show socks to give the look of no socks. They could easily be worn without socks, but I like to preserve my sneakers for as long as possible.\\r\\n', \"Super comfortable. I ordered a pair of the men's model as well (size 8.5 fit as well as the women's size 10). Following other reviewers, I ordered one size larger than normal, and that was a good call.\\r\\nI have the impression that the men's model was a little more cushiony than the ladies. Also, the men's comes in solid black. Note that the insoles in this model are not removable, so you can't fit any substitute orthotics.\\r\\n\", 'This shoe is cute and the memory foam makes you feel like you are walking on marshmallows.

No issues with rubbing or blisters. I wear 7.5 and ordered my normal size. Can't say enough great things about them! They're so lightweight, which helps with leg fatigue. I'll never buy another sneaker if I can help it.\", 'These are very comfortable with memory foam in the soles. I have two pair! Great for walking/travel, and I appreciate the more subtle color combos available. ', \"Love these shoes. I am an OR nurse so my job requires I am on my feet 10-12 hours a day. I was a little suspicious they wouldn't be comfortable due to the low price but I was wrong! I chose them over my clogs everyday. Very lightweight but give great cushion. I originally bought in my usual size, 7 1/2, but found the toe box to be a little short so I bought an 8 and am I'm very satisfied. Love Zappos quick shipping and great customer service \", \"Awesome light weight sneaker! True to size with an attached tongue that won't shift when running/ working out. I use them as my clean sneakers for Zumba class in a dance studio- they are perfect.\", \"These shoes are AMAZING! I own 3 pair! My only complaint is, is if you have sweaty feet the top of the insoles will start to peel. I ended up writing to Saucony and they sent me new insoles. They are perfect for an all day wear. Would't recommend for running. I ended up adding an insert for extra arch support, I have ridiculously high arches so nothing fits right.\", 'I purchased these shoes for every day wear and am happy with my purchase. Very comfy!

I'm sad that I have to return them.\", \"I wanted a lower profile, lightweight, and comfortable tennis shoe to wear around town and to Disney World. These definitely fit the bill. So far, I've worn them twice on long shopping trips and my feet haven't hurt or been tired at all at the end of the day. The memory foam is so comfortable it feels like walking on pillows. I did have to go up a half size. I'm normally an 8, occasionally an 8.5, and the 8.5 is what I had to wear in these shoes.

I have never found a pair of running shoes I like until I found these.\\r\\nThe old pair still looks new, so I'll wear those for around town.\\r\\nI wear size 9 and it's perfect (I have narrow feet, but the fabric of the shoe hugs my feet).\\r\\nI've never worn Saucony shoes before, but I love the Kineta Relay.\", 'really nice, comfy shoe. Runs small though. I am consistantly a 7 and am going to have to exchange this for 7.5', 'Super cute, comfortable shoes.', 'Very comfortable and light weight. This is not a workout shoe, more like a cute running errands, type shoe. Runs about a half size small so do size up. ', \"I'm on my second pair of the heather/black Kineta Relays.\\r\\nThese are my primary work shoes, 8 hours standing...on concrete.\\r\\nWhat they don't offer in support is more than made up for in comfort.\\r\\nThe stretchy upper of the Kineta provides room and relief for my bunions\\r\\nand the cushy sole is a dream to walk on. I find a 1/2 size larger than my normal size is best.\\r\\nDrawbacks are minor...\\r\\nThey wear down in both tread and cushion faster than I'd like but I do wear them A LOT!\\r\\nI also wish that ALL the Kineta colors were made with the same stretchy upper. The ones with the mesh covering don't have the same give.\\r\\nFinal note: Zappos, as always, is fantastic for speed and service.Thank you!\", 'I needed a new pair of sneakers for gym workouts and walking/light running in my neighborhood. I read some reviews here which cautioned against them being enough shoe for more vigorous workouts but I really liked the way they looked so I took a chance and bought them anyway. They are indeed cute, comfortable shoes but I don\\'t believe they are supportive enough for a good workout or run. I\\'m going to keep them anyway because I do think they will be good for casual weekends, shopping, chores around the house, etc. I normally wear a 10 and am glad I heeded the advice of others and ordered up. I got a 10.5 and they fit perfectly. The description on the box specifically says these are \"for light workouts\". ', \"These are insanely comfortable shoes! Light weight and instantly comfy. However the down side is that the bottom treads wear out super fast. I'm on my 3rd pair in a year and I'm not using them for crazy mileage anymore. I was using them as my 10,000 steps per day shoes but because the treads wear so fast they just became my wear as needed shoe ... and the treads still wear so fast. (Shoe fabric still looks brand new but bottoms are totally wrecked.) So I keep replacing them - they are just.that.comfy. If you're looking for something for a few days on your feet in Disney, or a State Fair, or something like that these are your shoe.\", \"These are slippers in disguise! The most comfortable shoes I've worn. They are roomy and a bit wide without feeling loose. However I decided to return them and go with a different Saucony. These are made with a lot of fabric material hence the softness and comfort. But I don't feel that over time they will keep a nice shape. Just general walking and the heel crinkles and slouches. I also don't think the fabric will stay clean easy. \", \"It's tough for me to judge the size on these, maybe run a little small? I wear a 7.5 in Nike (6.5 or 7 in regular shoes) and I definitely need a 7.5 in this shoe. They are very light and very comfortable, but the Coral... isn't 'Coral' by any stretch of the imagination. Should be called 'Traffic Cone Orange'. Seriously the color of a traffic cone. Returning that color, and trying to decide on a different color.\", 'These sneakers were comfortable right out of the box... I would have liked if the innersole were removable as I have my own custom orthotic insert. Since I ordered a half size larger than I usually do, I am still able to use it with the innersole that is permanently in the shoe. The color is very vibrant, great for running or walking now that it gets dark so early. You\\'ll be spotted a mile away! My only complaint is the color of the laces... they are described as \"mint\" but they look more like they are just dirty and the stripe one the side is a very faint \"mint\" as well. I replaced the laces with the coral ones in the box, but pure white laces would be fine as well. One other thing... if you are looking for a warmer running shoe to wear outside this time of year, this may not be the shoe for you. The mesh upper is very breathable, which is great, but you can feel the cool air on your feet until you get going at a good pace. Overall, I\\'m happy with them and people stop me on the street to compliment them!', ' Love them for running around town and doing errands and playing at the park with the kids not so crazy about working out in them for a hard workout or a long run! ', \"These shoes were extremely comfortable to wear, but ultimately I returned them because I didn't feel they were very stylish. My feet are on the narrow side and wearing these shoes made them look very wide, probably because the bottom of the shoe is bright white and the heel is large.\\r\\n\", \"I bought these because of the reviews, specifically about comfort and cushioning. I'm not sure what others are talking about. I found these to be very flat feeling and almost no cushion. I was hoping for a walking shoe with a tiny bit of bounce but these didn't do it for me. I also found them to be about a 1/2 size smaller than a regular 8.5\\r\\n\", 'Cute shoes but they run a little small. Go up a half size larger. I need to return them.\\r\\n', \"Let me start with the fact these feel like slippers. You would think this is a good thing, right? Unfortunately not in running shoes.. they are so soft and squishable they are awful for support.

I wanted a comfortable Trail shoe that wasn't bulky like a hiking boot. This was it. I usually wear a size 8, but due to Zappos great return policy, I ordered an 8.5 and a 9.0 The 9.0 was the one that fit. I loved this shoe, but it does not keep out water or sand.\\r\\n\", 'too small. will order a 1/2 size up\\r\\n', \"This is the first pair of running shoes that I had to order in a size 8.5. I wear and 8 in almost all other running shoes, and occasionally a 7.5, which is my usual size in non-running footwear. Another reviewer mentioned that these run wide, but I did not find that to be true. They are just barely wide enough in the toebox for me. I wish they were just a bit wider. I have very thin feet, with skinny heels and a wider forefoot, but have never needed to buy a wide shoe. I also ordered a men's size 7 for comparison. They were the exact same length as the women's 8.5. They had more room in the toebox, which I liked, but they were too loose in the heel and arch area, so I ended up keeping the women's 8.5. I am running with a slightly thinner sock than normal, to give myself a little more room in the toebox. Excellent shoe for trail running. Very stable on all sorts of terrain, and super grippy soles on steep slopes. Nice, close to the ground feel, good firm cushioning on trails. A little too firm for asphalt, but ok for short distances. \", 'Comfortable right out of the box. No break in time needed.\\r\\n', 'comfy shoe. good traction, but need to size up 1/2 size\\r\\n', 'I bought Saucony Peregrine 7 for myself as well as a pair for my husband in our usual sizes - had to send both back for a 1/2 size larger. Love the shoe and of course, Zappos speed, convenience and selection are always top notch!\\r\\n', \"These running shoes are gorgeous and bright, but more importantly, they are comfortable! I'm just returning to running daily again after a broken ankle, and during my first run I felt like they were broken in!\\r\\n\", 'Runs small', 'I usually wear Saucony Omni for running in size 8.5. This shoe runs smaller, so I needed a 9. It has some arch support, but I still needed my usual orthotics.', \"Saucony is one of the few shoes I can wear without ordering wide, I also wear orthotics in my shoes, and these still fit. I love the sewn tongue so it doesn't slide off to the side I run agility with my dogs, so I need good traction to be able to stop, turn and kick off. \", \"I wanted these to work. They had great traction, a nice design and color. But sadly I couldn't get the shoe to fit comfortably when I put them on. They were a bit wide in the toe box - to keep my foot from sliding around, I had to lace them up tightly, then my foot was falling asleep. Wished they made this in a slightly narrower width. I really liked the design and they seemed like they'd be great on trails.\\r\\n\", 'I love the look and feel of this shoe and the fact that it doesn’t have the useless memory foam insert that all tennis shoes are going with now. Unfortunately this shoe is not true to size. I wear an 8 medium width, this shoe felt like a 7.5 and fit very tight all around.\\r\\n', 'After wearing Asics for years, I thought I would venture into new territory & try Saucony, knowing the brand to be reputable.\\r\\nI have wide feet, and the toe box was accommodating. I have high arches and felt little to no contact with the arch of my foot. This cushioning may have given way after some wear, but both sizes I tried failed.\\r\\nI ordered up 1/2 size. Too long. I order my actual size. Length OK, but my heel still slipped out with every step. The heel cup is too shallow, and no amount of creative lacing corrected this issue.\\r\\nServes me right, I suppose, for cheating on Asics.\\r\\n', 'I have the Peregrine 6 that have worn out so decided to replace them with this model.

I have arthritis and nerve problems in my feet; when I bought these shoes, I could finally walk without pain. They are so good, I bought a second pair. The structure of the shoe under the front of the foot seems to roll the foot forward so that there is not as much flex in the toes, which is great if you have any arthritis. Also I think it makes walking less stressful in general. I am able to walk a long way now, whereas before I bought these shoes, I was hardly walking at all. I would recommend them to anyone with foot problems, but also to anyone who likes to walk a lot; they are comfortable, sturdy, and well-structured. I got wide, which works for me, and the heel is not too big as can happen with wide shoes. I walk a lot in the park, on hills and in woods etc. with my young dog, and they provide excellent support.They are the perfect walkers!', \"I needed walking shoes ordered these based on all the positive reviews and this shoe did not disappoint.

The Grid Omni Walker is my new love and I am thankful to Consumer Magazine for bringing this quality shoe to my attention. I agree 100% with their assessment of this Saucony Model. I have peripheral neuropathy which makes wearing most shoes extremely uncomfortable to downright painful. The padding and stability of this shoe has helped me immensely. I forgot to mention that I also have three hammertoes on one foot that I have to be aware of when trying on shoes. I \"normally\" wear a size 11 Medium but I decided to order the 11 wide as well to see which would be the best fit all considered. I ended up keeping the 11 wide as it allowed more give in the soft and pliable leather that covers the toe area. It was a hard decision but I factored in the fact I could always wear thicker socks IF the leather decides to stretch out as time goes on. The shoe is well made and I believe I will get a lot of wear out of them before it is time for a replacement pair. Anyone suffering from pressure problems in their walking shoes should give these guys a test drive and see if you are as pleased as I am. Zappos makes it possible to try different combinations of sizes in shoes to find the best fit for anyone willing to take the time and effort to order them carefully using the reviews left by others.\\r\\n', \"These are great shoes.

I finally gave up on finding New Balance shoes that are narrow enough. Almost all of them run wide. These are my first Saucony shoes, and I am very pleased with the stability of the shoe for athletic walking and also with the ankle support. The fit is just right. No rubbing anywhere. I added an insert for more arch support. The wide sole offers great stability but manages to make even my narrow feet look wide. I intend to wear these for brisk walking, not for casual wear.', 'I have had Saucony running shoes, and they are excellent for support and comfort. My husband and I walk 4 miles a day a few times a week, and the running shoes are not appropriate. I usually wear Asics or New Balance walking shoes, but both are mesh and too cold for winter. I bought these because they are leather all around and warmer for winter walking. They were comfortable right out of the box, although they feel a bit stiff. I wore them the first day for 4 miles and had no issues. I have to get used to the stiffer leather feeling vs mesh, but they are comfortable and provide excellent ankle support. They are true to size, although my heel slips up a bit when I walk. That doesn\\'t bother me because I don\\'t like my sneakers tight. They are \"clunky\" looking, so this would not be a sneaker I would wear out except to walk. I ordered others, but these were the most springy and provide very secure ankle support. I would recommend these. Saucony always makes a very high quality shoe.\\r\\n', \"I love these shoes.

How in the world they get deliveries out so quickly is astounding. Love how you can track the package as its moving online too!

The front radius of the shoe is wider than others but the lace-up area is a flattering cut. I ordered an 8 which is a half size larger than my actual shoe size since last pair 7 1/2 ran quite small in the toe area.

I finally gave up on finding New Balance shoes that are narrow enough. Almost all of them run wide. These are my first Saucony shoes, and I am very pleased with the stability of the shoe for athletic walking and also with the ankle support. The fit is just right. No rubbing anywhere. I added an insert for more arch support. The wide sole offers great stability but manages to make even my narrow feet look wide. I intend to wear these for brisk walking, not for casual wear.', 'I have had Saucony running shoes, and they are excellent for support and comfort. My husband and I walk 4 miles a day a few times a week, and the running shoes are not appropriate. I usually wear Asics or New Balance walking shoes, but both are mesh and too cold for winter. I bought these because they are leather all around and warmer for winter walking. They were comfortable right out of the box, although they feel a bit stiff. I wore them the first day for 4 miles and had no issues. I have to get used to the stiffer leather feeling vs mesh, but they are comfortable and provide excellent ankle support. They are true to size, although my heel slips up a bit when I walk. That doesn\\'t bother me because I don\\'t like my sneakers tight. They are \"clunky\" looking, so this would not be a sneaker I would wear out except to walk. I ordered others, but these were the most springy and provide very secure ankle support. I would recommend these. Saucony always makes a very high quality shoe.\\r\\n', \"I love these shoes. I was having trouble with my heels after cardio rehab and when I saw that these shoes had extra cushioning in the heel, I couldn't wait to try them and they worked! I have no more problems with heel pain.\", \"This is a great pair of walking shoes. I walk several 5K's each year and needed a new pair of shoes. Have a narrow foot and these fit very well.\\r\\n\", 'Purchased these for my daughter (she\\'s a nurse doing 12 hour shifts in endoscopy) and she has thanked me over and over for these shoes. We had to return a pair of \"Skechers Softies\" to get these instead -- my daughter has a high instep and needed the wider width these were a perfect fit she said. Ordered her correct size, 8 1/2, and they fit perfectly she said. Zappos is magnificent with their overnight delivery! They are amazing actually. How in the world they get deliveries out so quickly is astounding. Love how you can track the package as its moving online too! The return of the other pair was easy and the refund processed very quickly. I love Zappos! And now my daughter does too! She would have had to hike through the mall on her day off with sore feet to find a pair (she just started a new job), but online, just a few clicks and her feet were happy again. Thanks Zappos! You guys totally rock! And that\\'s because the first day that my daughter wore these shoes, she texted me from work: \"Wearing new shoes today. I love you Mom -- you rock!\" Hope this review helps your decision!', \"Great shoe!\\r\\nI have been searching for years and have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a comfortable, well fitting shoe that didn't rub any where or slide up and down on my heel. I am finally at peace; I have found the Saucony Omni Walker. I love it! I have a wide foot, high instep, narrower heel and a bunion on one foot, so, to find a shoe to accommodate all that is rare. It was perfect from the beginning. I do pay attention to the comments of others customers and it helped me decide to purchase these shoes. Thank you. Zappos is great to deal with. Hassle free on-line shopping. I have never had one problem buying or returning shoes, and I truly value the convenience.\\r\\n\", 'Love it -\\r\\nWear them to work for 12 hr shifts on concrete floors. They are wonderfully comfortable shoes.\\r\\n', 'Nice Looking Sneaker - Pretty Comfortable -\\r\\nOverall this sneaker is comfortable, although after reading recommendations on its heel support I was a bit disappointed on the lack of arch support and cushion in the heel. The front radius of the shoe is wider than others but the lace-up area is a flattering cut. I ordered an 8 which is a half size larger than my actual shoe size since last pair 7 1/2 ran quite small in the toe area. I would recommend for comfortable toe room to order a half size larger than actual size. No big complaints, I added some heel cushions and the shoe is very comfortable for long walks.', 'Other Saucony walkers have fit true to size, but for these I ended by ordering a 7; so you may need half a size larger. They are very comfortable on long walks and did not need breaking in.', \"I have been wearing Saucony's since a Physical Therapist recommended them at least 10 years ago. It is just a great shoe and the support is exceptional!\", \"I have a very weak ankle from a break and these are the first shoes that actually make it so my ankle doesn't hurt me. Love them and will never wear anything else but them. The one small downside I have is they squeak.\", 'Ordered these shoes because of a problem I have been having with a bunion on my right foot. They fit like a glove - I prompted walked 3 miles on my treadmill pain free and no pain with my bunion today. As usual, Zappos got them to me the very next day with free shipping. As far as I am concerned, this company sets the benchmark in Customer Service every single time. Thank you!', 'The fit is true to size and extremely comfortable. Lightweight yet very supportive. I am very pleased with this product.', 'These are great shoes! I freaked out when I realized that Saucony no longer made the Grid Integrity ST which I had been ordering for several years. I walk four miles twice/week and take aerobics three times a week. And I wanted a pair of shoes which could do both. I ordered and returned the Saucony Progrid Integrity ST. Then I ordered these and they are great.', 'Wow...\\r\\nI needed white shoes for nursing school. I have wide, short, flat feet that are hard to fit properly and knee pain. These shoes fit like a dream and I can even JUMP in these shoes without any pain in my knees. If you have Fred Flintstone feet like me, these shoes will work for you!\\r\\n', 'These shoes are true to size and comfortable. However, the white/silver color is actually silver with white details.

No problems in fit: true to size and is very comfortable.\\r\\n', 'These shoes are very comfortable and cushioned. They accommodate my custom orthotics very nicely, and a wide width had a narrow enough heel that there was no slipping.', 'Saucony Grid Omni Walker W -\\r\\nExcellent shoe, so glad it comes in small sizes and wide widths. I recommend to anyone as an exercise shoe.\\r\\n', 'Ugly duckling -\\r\\nWhen I took these shoes out of the box, I thought they were the ugliest shoes I have ever bought. But, I went back to the reviews and remembered why I bought them. I have been having severe knee pain and thought more supportive shoes would help. Within the first day of full wear, my knee was feeling better. Two weeks later, my knee is not swollen. I work part-time on my feet and walk a lot, and just wearing these for work has helped me tremendously. I am going to buy another pair of walking shoes (trying a different brand - wish me luck). I usually wear a medium, but I ordered the wide and the medium. Tried on the wide first and they fit perfectly. As for looks, one friend commented on my \"orthopedic\" shoes, but they look better to me now. Also, they feel very light on my feet, and I can move around well in them. I really appreciate all the information and customer reviews Zappos includes for each shoe. It really helps with the selection process.', 'True to size and very comfortable!\\r\\nThis shoe is the most comfortable walking shoe I have ever worn. The most surprising thing is that the shoe is very lightweight. I always check Consumer Reports before purchasing just about everything and they rated this shoe as one of the best. They were \"right on\" as usual.\\r\\n', 'Great walker!!\\r\\nThis is my second pair and I love them. I am still using my first pair after putting 50 miles a week on them for the last 4 months. They have lots of wear left. I got the second pair just in case they became unavailable by the time the first pair wears out.\\r\\n', \"I have had three pairs of these shoes and they are very comfortable, but all three pairs squeaked like crazy! I'm a nurse and I walk all day. The squeaking drove me and everyone else nuts.\\r\\n\", 'Very upset when I received this pair and discovered the Wide is a full 1/8 narrower than my last pair! What gives! I have been buying the Omni Walker for years. I alwyas buy the exact same size. Wonderful shoe. I tried these on and before I even took a step they hurt! Measured the rubber part of the sole at the widest part and yup, they are 1/8 inch more narrow that my prior pair. Very, very disappointed in Omni!', \" I am 61 and purchased two pairs of the Saucony Omni Grid Walkers in size 8.5 medium, one pair in white and one pair in black. I found that both fit very differently. They both fit true to length, but the widths are very different. The white pair was much wider (which would allow for thicker socks if desired) than the black pair in the toe box area. The heel area fits the same, not too loose. The white shoes look much wider as well. The black shoes are more streamlined looking but still had plenty of area in the toe box. This can be a plus if you get into vigorous walking and want to give your toes plenty of room to flex without pinching.\\r\\nIn my opinion, the black Omni's fit the best but still run on the wide side. I would order a narrower width in the white Omni's if ordering again.\\r\\nAs far as comfort, I over-pronate a bit but never purchased shoes that addressed that problem until now. These walkers are very comfortable and reposition my foot so that I don't get the shin splint pain. Would definitely purchase again. \", \"I'm on the fence about this shoe, and will wear it (on carpet) a few more times so I can make up my mind. I suffer from fallen arches and it's hard to find walking shoes that work for me. These have the arch support I need, but after wearing them about 3 hours, my right arch started to hurt! They feel a bit stiff. The pros are that they fit true to size and they're a smart looking walking shoe. We shall see..\", \"I wear a size 9 M in these and they fit great. I have a bunion on my left foot and these provide comfort the leather conforms to the foot which stretches to accommodate it. I've been wearing Omni Grids for years. I walk my dog 3 miles every morning and these feel very supportive. They have a wide toe box which also makes them good for problem feet. I will always buy them please don't discontinue these Saucony! I highly recommend these shoes you won't be disappointed. \", 'I purchased these shoes for work. I am a nurse and work in an operating room so stand for hours at a time in the same place. They give good support and my feet feel fine after a long day. I can put my arch supports inside. Good room in the toe. I will purchase these again. ', 'I have a terrible time finding shoes that fit and give enough support (and allow me to wear a plastic arch support in the shoe). Also have I believe it is called pronation when I walk and lower back problems. This shoe was recommended by a shoe store after they watched me walk. Have been wearing it ever since and it is soo comfortable. Work in an office and the black works out well. Also have a pair in white. Runs true to size in length and width.', 'These shoes support the motion of the walking foot. I have slight to moderate pronation and this easily stabilizes that without making my foot feel unnatural. Comfortable walker from the start. The style gets a 4star because if I could improve these at all I would give them a slightly rounder roomier toe. ', \"I am ordering my 4th pair of these wonderful shoes. I suffered two years with debilitating chronic plantar fasciitis and heel spurs in both feet - from standing on concrete at work, BEFORE I found these miracle workers. The comfort is unparalleled - having ordered 5-6 other styles and trying them on side by side before finding Saucony. I wear custom orthotics and they are deep enough to fit. The toe box is roomy, the extra holes at the top for proper lacing for support of ankle is much appreciated AND they wear like iron. I 'recycle' them to yard work when the heel liner* wears out - for me is about 9 - 12 months with DAILY wear in/out of house, shopping and walking the neighborhood. These are the only shoes I wear. After 3.5 year of wearing them. I do not suffer from either foot ailment but I still will not wear any other walker. I love that they come in all white or all black. They go with everything. Classic. Great value.\", \"I think these would be great support but they don't fit me. I need shoes to be wider up front and for some reason all shoes seem loose in the heel lately. Is it possible to lose weight in your heels?\", 'I work at hospital and 12 hour shifts and my feet feet wonderful. I wish they had some ventilation because my feet get hot.

', 'I am an \"orthopedically rearranged\" 65-year old former athlete. Walking and short hikes are daily activities for me. This shoe provides stability, some pronation support and much comfort to my foot which has a high instep and arch and needs a shoe that come in wide. I wish Saucony would make this in a cooler mesh model. In the past they offered a trail shoe in mesh that was cooler in the summer months.', 'This shoe is very comfortable for my narrow feet.

Other than that this is a wonderful shoe and I will look for more made by this company.', 'I just received the Saucony Omni Grid Shoes and they are really comfortable with a great arch support. I have orthotics so comfort and support are uppermost for me.', 'Wonderful shoe -\\r\\nI have problem feet. I need a lot of shoe padding or it feels like I am walking on rocks. These shoes are very comfortable. The front of the shoe looks slightly pointed, but comfort is the most important thing to me. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe and always buy an 8 in tennis shoes to allow for heavier socks.\\r\\n', \"Greatest walking shoes -\\r\\nSo far I’ve bought 3 pairs of walking shoes from Saucony’s and each pair has been great. I have a bad back they help a lot. I go out to walk my dog and my back doesn't hurt as much with these on. Couldn’t ask for better shoes.\\r\\n\", 'These have been perfect for me. I just ordered my 3rd pair. I was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis a few years ago and fitted for orthotics by the doctor. He inspected these when I bought them and gave them the \"green light\". Usually after a year I like to replace them, as I wear them to work often, and want to keep them looking new. I wear them with black pants so they don\\'t stick out at the office. I alternate between these and more dressy shoes depending on my schedule, and they always return my feet back to the way they should feel, no pain. ', \"Excellent good looking sneaker for all my running around. I like that it is all white with a few silver accents. I don't mind bright colors on my running shoes, but I don't want it for my errands shoes.\", \"Shoe was a little narrow in the toe box for my liking. Overall a very nice sneaker, but I think more appropriate for the older crowd. (I'm 39.)\", 'These provide excellent stability due to the relatively stiff upper I suppose. I bought these three months ago and they are OK. This is from someone with foot issues who struggles to find comfortable shoes. For some inexplicable reason I liked them more at first than I did after a month or so. After a while of using these on the treadmill, I tried wearing the Nike Lunar Sweet Victory+ that I had bought at the same time. I found that I could walk at least twice as long with the Nikes, which were not specifically for walking. So these Sauconys are sitting there getting only occasional use while I am ordering a back up pair of the Nike Lunar Sweet Victory+.', 'These shoes are nice and sturdy. Not the best looking but great for walking around.', \"I love Saucony shoes and have over 10 pairs. They are always super comfortable and true to size. I purchased these because we have to wear all black shoes at the dental office I work at. I usually wear an 8M which normally fits my narrow, flat, foot very well. However, this style has a higher arch, felt wider, and slightly larger than my other Sauconys. The shoe was slipping off my narrow heel and I have not ever had that problem with 8M Saucony's before. I had to return them. I am going to stick the mesh/non-leather Saucony's from now on. I still love this brand, just not this particular style.\", \"I usually love Sauconys but this style is not as cushioned as other I've owned. I ordered the 7 1/2 wide, my usual size, and they fit perfectly. I suppose I could insert a gel insole. Since I'm on my feet a lot, it would help.\", 'Looking for comfort -\\r\\nI have been trying to walk every day and need shoes that will not be too hot and heavy and also not cause shin splints. I have been buying Dr. Scholl’s but no longer could find the ones I liked and this shoe was my 3rd try. Comfortable and lightweight and so far so good. It was good to read about Consumer reports reviews too.\\r\\n', \"Clunky but Comfortable -\\r\\nThe third shoe I've tried in the last two months or more. Hard to fit - 5-1/2, high arch, neuroma on right foot, pronation. This shoe feels like it will do the job for exercise-type walking, but it makes my feet like twice as big as they are. No beauty winner.\\r\\n\", \"I taught aerobics for 15 years and always bought Avia for that, retiring an old pair into my walking shoes. I have small feet, a high arch, and an old broken toe, making it challenging to find shoes that are comfortable and supportive. I've also tried Adidas and New Balance, but never got the right fit. I had a pair of Saucony [Original's?] a long time age that were the best, so I decided to try them again. They could use more cushioning under the balls and toes, but overall, I'm very happy with these shoes. I haven't tried inserts or orthodics yet.\", 'Consumer Reports Recommendation -\\r\\nI purchased this walking shoe because Consumer Reports recommended it. I really like it however I wish the arch was a little higher. Overall though, this is a good purchase.\\r\\n', 'Saucy Saucony -\\r\\nI had worn Saucony in the past but lately had not found them in a 10 1/2. These fit nicely and I am able to wear them all day without heel pain.\\r\\n', 'Good, Supportive Shoe -\\r\\nThis shoe is supportive for walking.\\r\\nIf you have BUNIONS, it is a bit pinching in that area.\\r\\nMaybe with some walking, they will stretch out, or maybe some bunions gel-protectors would be a good solution.\\r\\n', \"Saucony Grid Walker -\\r\\nThe shoe is very nice looking. My only problem is with the right shoe. My heel seems to slip in and out of it. It's also made higher on the right top of the right shoe. Its right under the ankle bone and it could be annoying.\\r\\n\", 'I purchased these 9 months ago, they were great. Comfortable and had really good support, but they already feel broken down.

Sturdy, well padded shoe for sure; however, I find it too \"pointy\" in the toe box, and it felt narrow to me in the bunion area. After several times of yet trying it again, I ended up with a foot pain that is still hard to tolerate, after several weeks. It goes to the thrift store -- maybe someone will find it comfortable.', 'Disappointed in the shoe. Seems that Saucony has downgraded their quality in the last half year. For the past several years, was always pleased with their shoes.', \"I needed a comfortable shoe in a wide width for work; I have to stand on my feet for about 2 hours continuously. This shoe, although being a walking shoe, felt very stiff around the ankle at first an needed some time to break in. Even though I've had it for a while it's still quite stiff, and my heels hurt after wearing it.\", \"Sorry to be a spoiler; but, I'm not really happy with this shoe. I've worn it to my health care job several times, trying several types of insoles as well as the ones that came with the shoes, of course. My feet have always ached by the end of my 8 hour shift with these. I have normal feet with a high arch. Think I'll go back to New Balance.\\r\\n\", \"I was just looking for a basic black sneaker for casual wear. I decided to return these because I was worried that the all-leather style would be too hot in the summer. The leather texture was a little too pebble-like for my tastes. The toe box was a little too pointy, which doesn't work for my duck feet. My heel was a little too narrow for this shoe, too. I thought they'd make my huge feet (10 1/2 D) look smaller, since they are all black. They somehow made my feet look hideous and huge. Overall, these would be great if you need an all-black all-leather sneaker for work, and if your feet aren't humongous in the front like mine are.\", 'Very comfortable but a little clodhopper-ish -\\r\\nThese sneakers are super comfortable and roomy for my Fred Flintstone feet. They are a bit bulky and unfashionable though. They make my feet look really big.\\r\\n', 'Nice look but...\\r\\nI like the look of this shoe. It is soft and cushioned well but... the arch is too far back. The arch hurts the front part of my heel and my feet hurt after wearing them and standing for short periods of time.\\r\\n', 'My foot is wide, I know that, but when I read how nice and roomy the toe box was on this shoe I expected that the shoe would fit my wide foot. The shoe was extremely uncomfortable and impossible for me to use for walking. If you have a truly wide foot, I would not recommend this shoe. Also, it was very stiff and uncomfortable\\r\\n', 'My daughter received this shoe August 9th. Wore it for two months and the heel fell off. The narrow fit was fine, but the shoe did not hold up.', 'Ordered these to help with heel pain, as the reviews claimed they had good arch support, and they do. Problem with the shoe is after several days of wearing they started to squeak. Like the shoe, but the squeak is annoying.', \"So disappointed! I really wanted to love these. When I tried them on at home they felt amazing, but then, on my first outdoor walk, the plastic heel cup cut into my heel and caused massive blisters. So painful! It's like it curves inward? I have normal feet and zero foot problems, wear almost all other brands just fine. I really don't know why I had a problem with these when so many other customers gave rave reviews. Kudos to Zappos customer service for working with me on these. Zappos rocks!\\r\\n\", \"If you need a wide toe box or even a round toe box, even in D width, this shoe has a narrow toe box. Don't even try it. I have mortons neuromas and need room in the toe, ask any podiatrist they will tell you that most of us need more room there regardless. Like all the other shoe companies they are making shoes more narrow. Why? Those of us with problem feet are having an awful time finding a shoe that fits, we do not care what the shoe looks like. I have a normal, almost narrow foot, but need a round roomy toe box. So I order D width, then the heel slips up and down because it's too big. And even with D width, the shoe is still too pointed or narrow at the toe. Have tried 8 different shoe companies now. My go to shoe was the Brooks Ghost and they have ruined that shoe cutting corners with materials and messing with the fit. If I find the hold grail shoe, I am buying 8 pairs of it because this is so aggravating and hard. SIGH.\", 'After reading the reviews I decided to try this walking shoe. Wearing around my house for a day, the ball of my foot was numb and tingling. The shoe was too hard in the ball area and the toe bed is spacious. Just not a good fit or feel for me.\\r\\n', 'I am so, so glad to have found this shoe. Thanks to all the other reviewers in helping me choose this. I have been suffering from ball of foot pain and have tried so many different shoes, inserts, etc. Nothing has worked for me til now. This shoe is the bomb for problem feet! I did end up putting in a pad for the ball of foot area, but no aching, no sore points. Just love it. I only wish they had this same product in a mesh style for the summer months, that would be awesome. (Also have tried expensive doctor endorsed sneakers recommended for my particular issue and those did not work either!) Thank you Saucony, I can walk again.\\r\\n', 'Comfortable insole, but high in back. Dug into my Achilles tendon. Narrower than hoped for in a wide.\\r\\n', 'I received these shoes just half an hour ago. I put them on and found they are a perfect fit! They feel sturdy yet roomy. Hooray! I found shoes that will work!\\r\\n', 'These are great for the gym. Any walking exercise and they truly are wide.\\r\\n', \"I've had several pairs of this shoe. They suit my arthritic foot, can be laced to a tension which is comfortable for the sensitive top of one foot. They come in wide which helps a lot too. I tried Avia's wide, but these work better for me. I don't depend on the arch support offered by the shoe which is not a lot, but it accommodates my orthotics perfectly after removing the liner. The shoes wear like iron. The current pair was getting dirty and worn looking, so I took out the laces and soaked them in detergent, scrubbed the shoe with a brush and some soapy Tide water, stuffed with newspaper to dry and they look much better now. I'll get some more miles from them.\\r\\nThat said, I would prefer something not all white, and they are a little clunky looking. They need a little style, color. But my feet don't care about color, just comfort, and these work.\\r\\n\", 'Appear very comfortable but they are larger than their size indicates. Will reorder as a 10.\\r\\n', 'These shoes have excellent arch support; if you normally switch out the inserts in shoes, you will not need to do it for these.\\r\\n', 'These run large. I have a long narrow foot and they are too big, and too wide.\\r\\n', 'These are the most comfortable walking shoes ever from the first time I put them on. No need to break them in\\r\\n', \"I have long, narrow feet and haven't been able to find comfortable shoes for work. I'm on my feet most of the day, and it's on a concrete floor. These shoes are excellent for my job! I had a short break-in period due to the great arch support, but I love these shoes! I have a pair of white and black for walking and when I need to wear black shoes for certain events. I wish they were readily available in retail stores in my area, but it's no problem ordering from Zappo's! Their shipping is prompt and free. This is really the only shoe I have found to be comfortable on my feet. I will buy these again, and hope Saucony continues to make such a great shoe!\\r\\n\", 'Nice shoe.

I bought the Omni based on all the positive reviews. I'm so glad I did! Great support and very comfortable.

These fit perfectly, but are just a little lacking of support for me. They are my weekend shoe only, as I need support for 12+ hours and these do not provide enough, even with my semi-custom orthotic from The Walking Company.

I bought these after doing my research (for half the price of Spira,) and I am thrilled with them. As soon as I put them on, my gait was corrected, the pain in my leg lessened, and my improved posture took weight off my back I didn't even know was there. These shoes have allowed me to stay on my feet longer with no pain, making my recovery faster and smoother.

I got the 8 Wide for a thicker sock and the 7 1/2 Wide for a thinner sock. I walk my dogs twice daily in mountainous terrain in a decomposed granite medium. The traction is not that good on this surface but it's doable. The fact that these shoes are comfortable from the moment I put them on for the first time is why I keep buying them.

A clean looking white shoe that fits very well.', 'Awesome arch support, stabilized walking and fit my orthotics.

I have a high arch on one foot and low arch on the other, but these shoes seem to work for me fine.', \"I ordered both these and the Vionic Walker since I'm recovering from Plantar Fasciitis. The Vionic's were just plain unattractive. I got these in a 9.5 but should have had a 9 but they were out of stock. They are comfortable and the insole is removable so I can put in a more supportive orthotic.\", 'Love these shoes. I had always bought New Balance but their quality has gone down in recent years. I intend to but another pair as backup.', 'Going on a vacation and wanted good support and comfortable sneakers for a lot of walking. I am breaking them in around the house and on the treadmill. So far so good. I find them hot and heavy but it is support that I am looking for.\\r\\nI will further comment after the trip.', \"I have ordered this shoe several times as I like the fit, it's comfortable and wears well. Although, I was surprised with the most recent pair when the sole of the shoe split and a huge chunk of rubber was flapping off, after less than a week of wear. As usual, Zappos stood by their guarantee and replaced the shoes even before I could return the defective pair. Thanks Zappos!!! \", 'I love these shoes. I\\'d read several other reviews from customers that traded in New Balance for Saucony due to the recent change NB has made in the proportions of their shoes. I have a wide foot and NB just doesn\\'t seem to accommodate my foot, let alone provide decent support. The Omni Walker does and though I was hesitant about buying shoes online without having tried them on, I checked my size with the \"true fit\" app at Saucony.com and ordered the size (which was a half size larger than I normally wear) they advised then put them on when they arrived...they fit like a glove and feel wonderful, even after a full day on my feet. I even feel the difference in the pronation of my step. These are great shoes and I highly recommend them. ', 'I love these shoes! They are exactly what I needed. I can wear them with black dress jeans and they look like regular shoes, not athletic shoes. Excellent support, comfortable and feet do not pronate. I feel balanced and stable when I wear them.

After a day of dress shoes I put these on with an aaahhh! Thank you Zappos for allowing me to try so many pair until I found the right ones.', \"Many shoes are too low at the toe for me to wear my orthotics. Not a problem with this shoe and they have great arch support even without the orthotics. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. \", \"These shoes are the best walkers I've ever had. They are very comfortable and just as important, they have excellent support. You can stand and walk in these all day long with no problems. I'd highly recommend these shoes.\", 'I need to wear an orthotic in my shoes due to a foot injury years ago. I love the Saucony Grid Omni Walker because I can get it in a wide width to fit my orthotic. Also, I recently realized that my size had changed (numb toes). I am so grateful that Zappos offers these sneakers in a size 12W and also in the color black which goes well with my winter and evening outfits. I would never be able to find these sizes in my local stores, nor do they carry this quality sneaker style that fits and looks so well. Your service and associates are the best!', 'I have wide flat feet, bunions and plantar fasciitis, so it is hard to find shoes that fits and are comfortable. These shoes fit and are amazingly comfortable. I have only worn around house so far, but will be trying them at work where I am on my feet 8 hours or so. They should work with orthotics. I use Powerstep Comfortlast also from Zappos. I am excited and will keep you updated!', \"I purchased a pair of Omni Walker for myself after purchasing a pair for my father. I've been dealing with plantar fasciitis for over 7 months and even had a broken metatarsal (4th) while dealing with the plantar. These shoes feel really good on my bad foot. They are very supportive, nice arch. They seem to help with the plantar issue even though in general my plantar pain is beginning to subside. They are more comfortable to wear than any other footwear I have at this point, even with the special insoles I purchased. I don't use any special insoles in the Omni Walkers and they are comfy for me. \", 'I was looking for a tennis shoe that was comfortable - I found it AND right out of the box. I have an issue with the big bone on the top of my feet. Both hurt, even to the touch, so a comfortable shoe is a must. This shoe is very comfortable and I was able to wear them right out of the box without a problem. I am even thinking of getting another pair.', 'Love these shoes! I work on my feet on hard floors and these shoes are the best I have found. As always Zappos is amazing to deal with. Seems like I just ordered the shoes and they were at my door!', 'I found this shoe comfortable with lots of support. I have been wearing for two weeks. My feet still get a little achy, I believe from better support than last shoes.', 'I took these shoes on a walking vacation right out of the box, recovering from a stress fracture in one foot, without a single complaint! I do not know how many pairs of these I have owned, but I hope and pray that Saucony continues to make them.

There're actually pretty stylish for shoes within this category.\", 'These shoes have a wide base of support and good arch support. They have been really helpful in avoiding ankle pain, which I used to get when wearing clogs at work (hospital). They are not the most stylish, but fine for work or walks/hikes.', 'I am so glad that I read the reviews on these shoe. I have narrow feet and have worn Propet and New Balance in the past. The Saucony is the narrowest, even though I had to tie an extra bow at the beginning of the laces. Should buy shorter ones, eh? Also, these shoes are much more supportive, with the removable insole being more cushy and sturdy. I cannot say enough about how pleased I am that I decided to switch brands. They cost a wee bit more, but are well worth it. And, of course, Zappos is the best company to deal with. I have been a customer for many years and will keep coming back. I love all the little extra messages on the site, in the e-mails, even on the box! Keep up the good work!', 'Received the Saucony sneaker in black as ordered within the week of when it was ordered.

So happy my friend recommended buying shoes thru Zappos!', \"I have worn Saucony Grid Omni Walkers for many years. I have narrow feet and plantar fasciitis and love to walk.

Everyone wears bright neon shoes, and I have to wear my black and white Saucony walkers.\", 'I have not worn then yet, but tried them on and walked around the house. The fit seems to be perfect.

I received these shoes last week and have worn them every waking minute since. The first day I wore them without my orthotic. They do have good arch support. I normally wear a 6 1/2 but order 7 1/2 in athletic shoes. The 7 1/2 were perfect for me. I am in shoe heaven! Thank- you Zappos for being patient with me while I searched for these shoes. As usual, outstanding customer service!', 'First time to try Saucony shoes. Liked the description That Zappos used on webcite. The very next day I was so impressed as I found out for myself that I agreed with everything written about these shoes. Comfortable and great fit. Took a long walk in them and did not have any problem with the shoes.', 'These are excellent shoes! Very stable and comfortable. I highly recommend them. Customer service was very helpful when I wanted to exchange for a wider width.', 'Easiest way to shop. Such ease navigating Zappos site. Love my shoes. Light weight and very supportive. True to size fit.', 'I love these shoes. The fit and support are great. Zappos delivered in record time. I will be ordering again. Wide shoes are so hard to find in stores. These are a perfect fit!', 'I like them very much. I have worn them walking and for all day wear for five days. They are a nice change from Asics black leather walkers for now.', 'These shoes are simply amazing. I have several foot issues and after wearing these for just one day, no more discomfort. No breaking in whatsoever. They give wonderful support and are so very cushiony. I highly recommend them for anyone who likes to walk or are on their feet most of the day. I absolutely love them!', 'These look heavy but are not really lightweight. They are very comfortable and I am looking forward to wearing them on a trip where we will be walking a lot.', 'I\\'ve worn this brand and style for many years. Saucony Grid Omni Walker is still my favorite \"go-to\" shoe. Zappos had the best price and I love their free shipping and free return policy. My shoes were shipped super fast. Thanks!', \"I wanted to replace two pairs of Saucony Grid walking shoes. Unfortunately, the model that I loved is no longer made, so I opted for this one. It fits well, is comfortable and well designed. My only complaint is that it doesn't have mesh that is breathable, as my feet get very hot.Also, I have a bunion and it would be more comfortable with a shoe with more flexibility around that area. However, I intend to wear it and enjoy it, perhaps not all day. I like the stability of the shoe. Feels like my foot is well cushioned and cradled.\", 'I wanted a shoe with a good arch support and this one fit the bill. It has good support and reading the reviews helped considerably in picking out a good shoe. After having back surgery I always need comfortable shoe with that exceptional arch support.', 'Perfection! Especially for those of us who have a long second toe! I am on the narrower side of M for width, and normally take a 10. For these, I ordered 10.5 to allow a little extra toe room, and they are perfect! The heel area is a little bit narrow like most Saucony shoes (in a Medium width), which is great for me because they fit well in the heel and through the middle of the shoe which keeps my feet from sliding forward, preserving the roominess I need in the toes! Right out of the box . super cushiony comfort! I have been a Saucony fan for years because the Medium width & 1/2 size up, fits my slightly narrow/long toed feet perfectly!', \"I have bought these shoes so many times I can't remember how many I have owned. They are the best shoe for anyone who is on their feet a lot. I have worn them to amusement parks where prior to owning these my feet would have been so tired at the end of the day, but these really support your feet and provide the best comfort I have found. I walk 3-6 miles a day and also have used these shoes for programs like p90x. I always know when I need a new pair because my ankles will start to hurt. This usually happens after a year of heavy use.\", \"I have been wearing these shoes for probably over 10 years. I've tried all kinds of walking shoes, and occasionally, I still do, but always come back to this Saucony Grid Omni Walker. I have plantar fasciitis and severely flat feet. I still wear an orthotic even in these Saucony Grid Walkers. No other shoe comes close to giving me the support that I have to have with my foot problems. Plus, I have narrow heels and I can count on Saucony to sell 2A shoes. I can wear these shoes all day and night, and never do they tire me or hurt.\", \"These shoes were comfortable the first time I wore them! They provide a lot of cushion when walking so they're just what I needed. I bought them a half size larger than my usual size to give my toes extra space, and that felt perfect as well.\", 'I just took these out of the box. On first glance, they are not very attractive, less so than in the picture, as if the photo was attractive, but hey, no attractive black walking shoes out there. Then, when I picked them up I thought, no way are these wide shoes. I put then on and wow! Great fit out of the box! I put them on without socks, nothing rubbing my feet. Put socks on and a Dr Scholls insert that I picked up at the drug store and my feet feel like thay have gone to Heaven. Now, I will be prepared to stroll the streets of Italy for hours on end!', \"I am very happy with this purchase. The sneakers are very comfortable and offer a lot of support and structure but don't look cumbersome. I removed the sock liner and my custom orthotics fit perfectly. No complaints - I would buy these again.\", 'Okay, so I look like a nurse while I am doing my daily 4 1/2 mile trek. Do I care? No. After trying a jazzier looking shoe and getting blisters big time, I got these. Right from the very moment felt great. I walk. I want comfort, support and no blisters ever! I also have a bunion that is not bothered one iota from these sneaks.', 'I have had several pairs of these Omni walkers. They are great shoes, actually have some leather on them and help with pronating. Also I can use my orthotics in them.', 'Very comfortable right out of the box. I need a good arch and these shoes have a very nice one. Wore them all day the very first day I had them. Also love Zappos service.', 'Super. Gorgeous. I have flat feet. My left foot is larger than my right. And this shoe allows me to walk and stand all day. I love this shoe.', 'I have a long, narrow foot and suffer from plantar fasciitis. This shoe has excellent arch support, accommodates my orthoses, and is very comfortable. Classic style in white leather. A winner. ', 'If you need arch support, these are the walking shoe for you.

First time I put them on, I forgot I had them on..walked around the house for a couple of hours, then went outside and got mail, went shopping etc. In all, had them on the firs time for about 7 hours. No problems at all..most comfortable shoes I can remember wearing. Customer service was fantastic, too....', 'Having flat feet I need lots of support. These are working great.

So far they are working well for me.', 'I love these shoes. I broke my foot a couple of years ago and these are the only shoes that I can wear and my foot does not hurt.', 'Good solid long lasting shoe, foot stability and comfort superb.

I can wear these shoes all day with no problem. I loved them so much, I bought a black pair last winter. Buy with confidence. THE BEST WALKER I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.', \"Fit my mom perfectly. She's never had shoes specifically made for over-pronation so it was life changing to start wearing these. Highly recommended.\", 'I always buy this Saucony shoe because I have narrow feet and it is extremely difficult to find a shoe that fits. I like to buy from Zappos because of their \"customer satisfaction\" policy is reliable!', 'This is a comfortable well made shoe that allows enough room for my metatarsal support orthotic.

Love them! I've had a lot of problems with heel spurs and arch support but these shoes are wonderful to wear!\", \"Great shoes for walking; I tried other brands, but this is the best. Comfortable, easy to wipe clean and great support. I'll stick to these as long as they make them.\", \"Great shoes. I had to get these for work,(standing on cement 7or more hours) at NYGiants/Jets stadium and they are comfortable. We have to have black shoes and my chiropractor said my other shoes were too heavy to walk so much in. Saucony is a great shoe, and they stand behind their products. I buy them all the time, can't say enough good things about this shoe and company.\", \"Hands down the best walking shoe I've ever bought for work! Super comfortable all day long,even after walking six hours a day the last three months. Fit my narrow feet and heels quite well. These have lasted much longer than the new balance I used to buy.\", 'These are a lot of bang for the buck.

There was no break in time and my inserts fit in them very will.', \"Love these - really comfortable, and perfect for winter. These will keep my feet a lot dryer than cloth/nylon shoes.

Already bought another pair!\", 'This shoe supports my slight overpronation and supports my ankles, knees, and back by providing a very stable sole. They enable me to walk a fast Labrador Retriever without pain and with stable steps. Because they\\'re black, I can wear them with my many black warm ups and black skinny jeans without feeling too unfashionable. However, I do call them my \"industrial\" Lab-walking shoes because they\\'re serious, heavy-duty shoes. They\\'re not terribly cushiony, but they do the job I need them to do and after I try more fashionable and bright colored athletic shoes, I always return to my black Saucony Grid Omni Walkers in. White is not available in my size for summer :(. I wear a 6.5 in regular shoes, and I wear a 6.5 in the Saucony Grid Omni Walker. Going to a 7 in other athletic shoes for length doesn\\'t work because a size 7 is too big in all the other areas of the shoe. In summary, this is the BEST shoe for me to allow me all-day comfort, support, AND stability. It is very reasonably priced also. I have ordered a second pair from Zappos to be sure it\\'s there when I need it. BTW...ZAPPOS HAS THE BEST SERVICE IN THE WORLD!

Bunions, narrow and very flat feet, accessory naviculars on both feet, knees out of alignment, you name it. These shoes made me feel like I could walk for miles! They are light and very sturdy, and I could actually feel the stability control as I walked. I wish I could wear these everywhere. Unfortunately, they are walking shoes of the orthopedic variety, and I wouldn\\'t want to wear these with a dress or a cute outfit... that being said, I am sorely tempted each time I go out to just say \"to hell with fashion\" and slip these babies on. Although for what they are, they are not ugly. They are not too granny-ish and can pass for normal sneakers. Get them!', \"A great walker! I've already logged a lot of miles in them and they get better with each trip. Great support and good fit.\\r\\nI would definitely purchase again.\", \"A comfortable and fabulous shoe! I wore these shoes every day for almost 3 weeks when we toured Scotland. My feet never hurt. Also, I usually wear orthodics, but I found that I didn't need them because the arch support in this shoe was perfect.

It is getting hard to find them so this is where I always go knowing they still have them.\", \"I've had several surgeries on my foot, and ankle, and could not find a sneaker that was comfortable for me. Until I purchased the Saucony Grid Omni Walker. They give me a secure fit, and stability I need when walking on the treadmill. I would recommend Saucony sneakers to everyone.\", 'I had a pair of these years ago and liked them, they were white. I now have a black pair and have worn them 2 days in a row and they have been comfortable. I have a wide feet plus a bunion on my right foot. These are working well for my feet with my job that has much walking and standing. Thank you Saucony for making a wide shoe!', 'After searching and trying 7 pairs, all prices,tried getting fitted in shoe store-would hurt after I got home, found this one from Zappos was the best. Comfortable right away, my pain was relieved with excellent well thought out construction. I over pronate and I wore these all day by day 2, no problem, hugs the foot without over squeezing. Very pleased will soon order a second pair for at home wear.', \"I've just started teaching my first year and knew I would need a comfortable shoe to break my feet into being up all day. These sneakers don't disappoint. No break-in time required, and the usual higher arch shape from Saucony to help those of us with high arch feet (though my arches appear even higher than Saucony designs). These probably have excellent arch support for most who need it - I think I have super arched feet and haven't found a shoe to match 100% yet. I will likely purchase other colors in this brand.\", \"Saucony Grid is the best shoe I have ever owned. I've been buying them for years. Yes, they change the style and bottom which sometimes drives me crazy...so that's why I buy more than one pair of the style I like.\", 'These are the BEST sneakers I have ever purchased and they are all WHITE!! Great fit and comfortable. First time trying Saucony brand.', \"My husband and I walk 10 miles a day and these shoes are the best I've found. Beyond that, ZAPPOS is the best retail company I've ever found. Customer service is all about you the customer. Efficient, helpful and quick!\", \"I broke my ankle a few months ago & desperately needed a good sneaker to help with stability & balance that would also be shock absorbing for the multiple terrains I walk on daily. I searched quite a few websites for a sneaker that was supportive, comfortable & true to width. I found it all in this one. I read through the reviews before committing and they really helped me decide. This is truly one of the best sneakers I've ever had.\", \"Wow, I read the reviews and now I have experienced the shoe. Love it so much I am back to buy a 2nd pair after 2 days because I don't want to chance it not being available when these wear out. If you have a sensitive heal issue like I do, these are wonderful too! They practically suspend the center of your heel and keep it from impacting the ground. Comfortable in every way. Thanks to other reviewers who helped me make this choice! I am a 9 narrow and these 9 (2A) fit perfectly with enough space in the toe box to feel roomy yet supportive.\", 'Shoes felt too small after wearing it in house also very orthopedic looking. Comfortable but not attractive!', 'I have had-to-fit feet. It is a challenge to find shoes that are comfortable. I had had name brand walking shoes in the past that have caused the bottom of my feet to blister and others the back of my heel to blister. Other shoes caused my feet to hurt after walking. These Saucony shoes are very comfortable throughout and after my daily walks on treadmill and on the street! P.S. I wear a size 8 shoe, but in this shoe 8 1/2.', \"I tried about four different kinds of Saucony styles before I settled on this one, but it was SO comfortable from the moment I put it on! I knew it would be the one, and it's been great. My feet are wide and I ordered the wide width, which seems to fit my foot perfectly. I would definitely recommend them.\", 'These shoes offer excellent support for over pronation. The sole is thick and offers relief from concrete. The sole is also wide enough to offer firm footing. They run true to size in length and width. The toe box is roomy. I ordered black, and after wearing them 2 days I have ordered another pair of black. I will order a white pair when Zappos gets them in. Shoes affect my body alignment. After wearing these 2 days, I put another pair of walking shoes on to work outside. That threw my alignment off again! I\\'m back in the Saucony Omni\\'s this morning as my \"slippers\" because I can do things in these other shoes won\\'t allow. As always Zappos had these (and 4 other pairs to try) on my door step in less than 24 hours! I sent all the others back after choosing the Saucony Grid Omni Walker. Zappos is fabulous and so are Saucony Grid Omni Walkers!', 'Was looking for a good fit and comfortable shoe for when I will be on my feet for a long period of time. These fill the bill!', 'This is probably my 5th of 6th pair of Saucony Grids. I buy a pair about every six to eight months. I walk a lot and I have very sensitive feet. The top part of the shoe is still in good condition. I highly recommentd these shoes.', 'This was the best shoe for my foot. I have a slightly wide foot, so I ordered a 7 wide. Fit was great. The sole has a good feel on the bottom of my foot..not too soft and not too hard. The shoe is easy to keep clean because it is all leather. I wanted a shoe that would feel cooler in the summer, but all those with the canvas did not give me a good fit. Price was very good and the delivery could not have been faster. Easy returns also.', 'Love these shoes! I have neuropathy and have to have good support, plus my feet are narrow! I am so pleased that these provide what I need to walk 2+ miles per day! Zappos is my go- to on line store for shoes!', \"Been a fan of Saucony walkers for years and will only buy from Zappos because I can trust the value and description of their products. Plus almost overnight delivery ain't bad either!\", 'You gotta love a shoe that\\'s comfortable right out of the box. With or without my orthotic, this is a great shoe. Felt true to size in every way. Saucony was my go-to-shoe before I discovered New Balance (which I still love) so here I am with Saucony again, back to the future. Speaking of New Balance, I love all my New Balance running shoes, which I use not for running but for walking and going to the gym. In addition, I can highly recommend New Balance\\'s Aravon brand of shoes. When I tried on their Katy sandal I was like, \"Where have you been all my life?\"', \"My left foot has pronation and I needed a walking shoe to support my foot. I ordered my usual size 7 but the shoe was too small. I could feel my toes touching the front of the shoe. I exchanged for a size 7.5 and the shoe fit perfectly. I haven't gone on my usual 3 mile walks but I've been wearing the shoe almost every day and it does prevent my foot from pronating. I also have high arches and it is providing good support for my arches.\\r\\nZappos customer support is excellent! I had to call and I got a real person right away who answered my questions and told me clearly how to do the exchange and what to expect in detail. Yes, she spoke clearly in English! And even though I called on a Friday, I received the exchange the following Monday! I've never received such fast service!! And THEY pay for the S/H both ways!! That is a rare thing nowadays. In fact, that is why I decided to order from Zappos plus the great price on the shoes! Zappos knows the real meaning of customer service.

      "{'shoe': 'Saucony Grid® Omni Walker ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': ['I purchased these for my rocking mom who is 84 years old. She says the wide width gives her just that extra bit of room that she was craving but did not know she was craving because her blood sugar was low. So anyway the Zappos representative that helped me with this order was the nicest James on the planet and I hope he had a great time at the concert and I love him from afar.', 'I love these shoes! They are so stabilizing! They accommodate orthotics very well. I have trouble with my feet and ankles and find these shoes help me a lot.', \"Saucony is the brand that fits my foot. Not NB or Brooks or any others I've tried. I have a medium width foot, and the only real anomaly that I know of is a high instep (my foot sticks up a lot above the arch, although the arch itself is only slightly higher than an average foot). Plenty of room for an insert, great quality. I also recommend the Progrid Integrity, except that my heel slid around in it just a bit. If you don't tend to have that issue with shoes (and I do), then it may be just fine for you and you can save a little over the price of the Grid Omni Walker. But either one is a great deal compared to NB and Brooks and the quality is at least as good.\", 'The shoes fit great. So comfortable. And I cant say enough about the customer service. They worked with me and I could not be happier with the service.', 'I love these sneakers as they are very comfortable. Can wear them for hours at a time. Makes you realize you should have bought a pair sooner!', 'I was pleasantly suprised when I tried this shoe, it is very comfortable. I ordered a wide because some of reviews said it ran narrow. I found I probably could have ordered a regular medium size.', \"I really like these shoes! I had been wearing orthotics, but they (tho' supposedly permanent) were hurting my feet by the end of the day. With the Sauconys, I don't need the orthotics.\", \"These are very sturdy shoes, however they run very short. Probably the most sturdy walking shoe I've had in years. I normally wear a 10, I ordered an 11 and they are still not that roomy. They are not very stylish, but definitely worth the money if you are an avid walker like I am.\", 'Very good arch support, not dainty. Great as the shoe I can wear all day at work when I need to be on my feet.', 'These shoes rank as one of the best I have ever worn. They are not only comfortable but they have wonderful support for my flat feet an plantar fascitis. I highly recommend them.', 'Well made shoe but I was disappointed. The shoe runs large and the toe box is too wide. I am sending this shoe back because it is too large and the medium is too wide. I love Zappos and I will look for another pair of shoes. Would not buy nmy shoes from anyone else.', 'The Saucony Grid Omniwalker is very comfortable. The shoes felt comfortable the minute I put them on. They have a lot of cushoining and great arch support. There is plenty of room to wiggle your toes. I wish they came in beige or brown!', 'I am very happy with the shoes. They are comfortable and the delivery was quick. I had ordered a black pair in another style which hit my ankle wrong and the return process for those was simple and quick.', \"Of course I was hesitant to buy any type of footwear on-line. I bit the bullet and ordered through Zappos. I couldn't be more pleased. On one occasion I ordered the wrong size. I free shipped the item right back to them without a problem. I received the new item before I even mailed back the original. Quick delivery. Excellent service.\", 'Got this shoe for work. I stand and walk on a concrete based floor and need good support. This shoe does the trick. I even bought an extra pair!', 'I have a difficult time finding a good shoe with my size 12n. This shoe is one of the best that I have ever had. I plan to order this again.', \"I am a nurse and work 12 hour shifts on my feet. White shoes are the uniform. These are the best. My feet don't hurt at all, even after 3 shifts in a row. \", 'I really found these shoes to be comfortable. I have problems with my feet so finding comfortable shoes is hard. I liked these but I bought the Asics Gel Foundation Walking Shoe because they fit me a little better, for me.', \"I purchased these shoes based on all the great reviews. I wasn't disapointed. They have been great for the month that I've had them. Very comfortable for walking. I'm planning on taking them on vacation to Europe in a few weeks and will get a lot of use out of them I'm sure!\", 'I have been looking for a walker shoe that would help my plantar fasciitis and this is it! This has a great arch support without being uncomfortable and the heel is so comfortable. I can wear these all day without any heel pain at all. Also, Zappos has such great service. The shoes came very quickly. I ordered 2 sizes and the one I returned was credited very quickly. thank you, Zappos!', \"This is the first walking shoe I have purchased that wasn't NIKE. I LOVE these walking shoes! I went to NYC and wore these for the first time! I walked for hours and had no pain or blisters!! Very comfortable! I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear because of some of the reviews I read...but I think I could have gotten my regular size! I will be wearing thicker socks soon so it's not an issue! If you are looking for a comfortable walking shoe....I recommend these!! Just wish they came in different colors! White can be kind of boring!\", 'Bought these for work...I am a nurse and on my feet all day. VERY comfortable and supportive. my feet are not tired at the end of the day', 'This is the best shoe! My feet were going to sleep with reg. wt. shoes. I ordered these in a wide and love them. I will re-order! Thanks a million.', 'Great shoe, just with my huge feet, this color made them look like boats!', 'Hands down best shoes ever! Love them!

For the first time in a long time I found a pair of walking shoes (sneakers) that fit my whole foot. No heel slipping, no large toe bumping!', \"This is a very comfortable shoe. It is supportive, but doesn't feel heavy -- I have a narrow foot and heel, but like a roomy toe box. I've worn NB and Brooks Addiction, but both of those feel heavy on my foot -- this shoe feels lighter, but still provides great support and comfort. I'll buy it again.\", 'Very supportive and comfortable shoe. Accommodates my orthotic (I buy 1/2 size up). Always great service!', 'I finally found what I wanted...a walking shoe with plenty of cushioning and support. These are very comfortable shoes and the fit is exceptional. I have a wide foot. I ordered a half size larger and they are perfect. Will wear to work. Hooray...my search is over! Try these shoes! I just ordered another pair!', \"I first became a fan of Saucony when I was trying to live with the ill-fitting cheap shoes on sale. Store owner said to try the Saucony Omni Walker. He said for every $10 you spend on a sport shoe you get more quality -- and it was like stepping into heaven. No breaking in necessary, no sore heels, I've been a fan ever since.\", 'Very comfortable right out of the box - wear them at work all day and usually on my feet. Feet do not get overheated - very happy.', 'Love this shoe! I typically buy New Balance walking shoes but that changed when I purchased this shoe! Very comfortable shoe and no break in period. I absolutely recommend this shoe!', 'Overall a great shoe, quality, soft leather, not cheap looking like so many name brands that have downgraded their quality. The wide width is just right in the heel and overall. I would like to order another pair, just in case they discontinue or compromise quality for more profit.', \"These sneakers are the best! They have stability that keeps my back leveled out and is great on the feet and knees. My orthotics fit inside of them too. After searching long and hard going to many stores, I found these and read the great reviews. I decided to give them a try. I ordered a size 8 and a size 8 1/2. I usually wear an 8, but I did need the extra half size in these sneakers. I would recommend these highly. The back of my foot doesn't keep lifting out of this sneaker. If you have a more narrow heal, these are perfect. I will buy another pair in the near future. Zappos is great since they do not charge for shipping in either direction. Thank you Zappos!\\r\\n\", 'I usually kick my shoes off as soon as I get in but found that I was still wearing these for the remainder of the day. Very comfortable from the beginning!', 'Felt comfortable from first wearing. Have previously had two other Saucony walkers that were great, but these are the best by far.', 'Great walking shoes. I have a painful bunion and these are the only shoes, (tried 4 different brands before these) I can wear comfortably. Thank you Saucony for consistently producing athletic shoes with a wide toe box and exceptional quality. And thank you Zappos for suffering my endless returns until I found the right pair!', 'After ordering and returning countless pairs of shoes because my feet are touchy and difficult to fit, this pair worked well. It is clunky--but comfortable and I wore them every day for a week on a trip to Israel.', 'Wonderful shoes. Did not have to \"break\" them in. Felt comfortable right from the first day I wore them. I really love this shoe.', 'These are the most comfortable shoes ever! I am a pharmacist and my job requires being on my feet for hours at a time. These shoes provide great support. In addition they hold up very well. I have been through 4 pairs over the past 4 years; they are all still in great shape. The reason I had to replace them is that over time they become too dirty to look professional at work. I wear the older pairs at home and around town.', 'There are wonderful shoes. Comfortble right out of the box. I have difficulty finding shoes that provide support and are comfortable and was pleasantly surprised with these shoes. I have been wearing these shoes for 2 weeks now and have no complaints. I work in a hospital and am on my feet all day. I would recommend these shoes to anyone that does a lot of walking or standing.', 'Wow. I needed a good shoe for walking. These are the most comfortable walking shoe I have ever had on. Love them!', 'I love these shoes. The size was perfect and the stability it gives me while walking is great.', \"This shoe has plenty of toe box room, probably moderate arch support (I have high arches). It is quite comfortable and I was able to wear it with no break in period. This is my second pair of Saucony and this seems to be the brand that works best with my troublesome feet! (I have painful arches if they aren't supported enough. Also, get bruised heel and back of calf pain in the wrong shoes.)\", \"I'm a walker, not a runner, and my feet are my main source of transportation. I bought these shoes because I got sick of athletic shoes that left my feet aching and torn up at the end of the day. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned, hands down. I wear them for occasional cross-training and they provide amazing support. I have not had one blister in the 6 months I've owned them, not even after wearing them shopping, to work and on a 6-mile power walk all in one day. My feet tend to pronate, and if I wear improper shoes my knees hurt after a long day. That has never happened with these shoes. There is adequate room in the toe box, and they fit true to size (I take a 7.5 regular in almost everything, and that's what I ordered for these). They are also easy to waterproof if you buy a special product. I've gotten caught in the rain and they were fine. They seem to have good ventilation because I've never noticed a problem with my feet sweating, even after wearing them all summer in the Deep South. My only complaint is that they are rather functional looking, and not very modern or hip. I have worn them to work because it's inconvenient to bring other shoes to change into, but they scream walking shoe, unlike some of the other Saucony shoes that are funkier (but far less comfortable). Still, the wearability and support that these shoes offer make the comfort-for-style trade worth it every time. \", \"Needed a winter sneaker that looked good and were comfortable with my black pants. These are working nicely. The size is right on 11 AA. Need to wear sneakers all the time and I like my gait in these. I really love my Asics Nimbus 11's, these are a good second.\", 'These shoes are fantastic and so comfortable! I have many foot problems and arthritis as well. They are incredibly comfortable to walk in. I plan on buying a pair in white next! Best athletic shoe I have ever invested it!', 'I tried these after returning New Balance walking shoes. For me, these offer much better arch support and therefore are very comfortable. Plenty of room in the toe box, too. Very happy with these shoes.', 'This is a great walking shoe for people with narrow feet and high insteps (that would be me!) Very comfortable and supportive and not too heavy. And Zappos comes through efficiently as always! My go-to place for shoes.', \"These shoes fit very well. The cushion inside isn't too spongy; it has just enough spring to take the shock. I do a lot of walking with long strides. I cannot afford to have shoes that slip. These stay exactly where they should.\\r\\nI would say the only slight drawback is they need a bit more arch support.

I am on my feet most of the day, for 8 to 10 hour hospital shifts, and they're so comfortable I never even think about them. (Except that they do make a slight squeaking sound when I walk, though I usually don't notice that either.)

I feel like I have springs when I walk.\", 'This is the 4th pair of this shoe I have had and I love them. I walk for exercise 6-7 days a week, and find that they are very comfortable and hold up well. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys walking.', 'Bought these because of the rave reviews. Great shoe, true to size and comfortable with no break in. Happy to have them for walking, gym, hiking.', 'From the first time I used Zappos to get my Saucony Grid Omni Walkers I was very pleased. These walkers are the best fit for me and I get new ones every 6-7 months. Zappos delivers when they say they will. The few times I have needed to talk to a person have always been very satisfactory. I have not ordered anything else from Zappos, but that is mostly because I am not a big consumer at this point in my life.', 'These shoes are great! I had knee surgery a few months ago and I do a lot of walking in my job. These shoes support my foot and knee very well! This is really my 2nd pair of Saucony walking shoes. I wore the first pair out! This newer version of the shoe is the best!', \"I owned another pair of Saucony running shoes and had logged over 1200 miles on them. Needed to replace the shoes with a walking shoe due to an injury and the fact they were worn out. Decided to buy the Saucony Omni walker based on my experience and other recommendations. I chose to go with an 11B even though a lot of people suggested a half size bigger. It fits fine, but if I could do it over again, the 11.5B would be my choice. Know what thickness of socks you will be wearing. The arch support is phenomenal. Wouldn't trade that for anything. I hope this helps a lot. As for others comments on it being boxy or big or unflattering. I have yet to find a size 11 athletic shoe that is sleek and sexy. Gym shoes are meant to be functional not sexy. They are not as bad as some reviews make them out to be.\", 'The shoes fit perfectly and were comfortable from day one. I walk 4 - 5 miles a day and these are great for me.', 'I have bunions, hammer toes, and a high instep. Saucony sneakers are the best footwear for me. I can walk and stand in them all day and feel no pain at all. In fact, when I get home from work, I forget to take them off, they feel so natural on my feet. I got black for work so nobody notices that I am wearing sneakers.', 'This shoe was sized great. Supportive of the foot for walking. Love it. I also love Zappos, fast shipping and the complete site is easy to use and a great selection.', \"Really like the shoes. Didn't make my feet too big, which is a concern with a size 11. Nice soft insoles. Good arch support.\", 'I suffered a bimalleolar ankle fracture, and have eight screws and a metal plate in my ankle that will not be removed for many months yet. I have been looking for a pair of shoes that will support my ankles and provide a good cushion of support (I am a heavy woman and require good cushioning!). Initially the doctor wanted me to trade down from my calf high support boots (converse desert tactical boots was all I could find that would work at the time), to a mid/hi top tennis shoe. I could not find a mid/hi top that was comfortable, they all pressed against the metal plate on the exterior side of my ankle and it was unbearably painful. I opted to stay in my boots until I could find a great pair of regular walking shoes. These Saucony Omni Walkers are perfect! I was so afraid that my ankle would not get enough support, but these shoes hold your foot and ankle in place without making you feel like you are in a vice. They provide superior cushioning as is, and provide a very stable walking gait for me. I still limp a bit due to the major problems with the dislocation and break having really wracked up my tenodons and ligaments. However the comfort the shoe provides is better than any shoe I have ever worn. I hate wearing shoes period, as I am barefoot gal,- but I have been able to stay in these for full 12 to 14 hour days without wanting to take them off. They are amazing and just the right shoe for me! I wear a size 6.5 wide, and that is what I ordered. Even with the swelling that still occurs in my ankle, these shoes fit true to size for me. Any else recovering from an ankle fracture will probably benefit from these shoes.', 'The Best -\\r\\nI was amazed when I tried this shoe on. It was the most comfortable shoe ever, right out of the box. Good support and good looks, too. I have problems getting comfortable shoes and wear orthotics in my athletic shoes. These fit the bill for comfort and adaptability since the insole can be removed. I ordered several brands to try, but this was \"it\" as soon as I put it on. Thanks for the good service, too.'], 'num_helpful': [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5'], 'comfort': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5'], 'style': ['4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '4', '4', '5', '5', '4', '4', '3', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5'], 'size': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3'], 'width': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3'], 'arch': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3']}\n",

      "{'shoe': 'Saucony Grid® Omni Walker ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': [\"Super Comfortable -\\r\\nI have this shoe in white and wanted a black pair. This shoe has excellent arch support and I don't have to wear orthotics in this shoe. I have a wide foot and this shoe fits great. Wish Saucony made all their shoes available in wide sizes. This is a great shoe.\\r\\n\", \"Very nice -\\r\\nI was kind of nervous, since this shoe is a little narrower in the toe box than previous walker models in this brand. I've worn it several times, and it's fine. A really light, good shoe for walking. Zappos service was excellent, as usual. Great shoe, great service. Life is good.\\r\\n\", \"New Favorite -\\r\\nYou can't beat these shoes for comfort & support. I walk about 15 miles a week, and in the past have had trouble with the tendons in my feet. I've been wearing another brand for the past several years but I decided to try these after reading the reviews. I'm really glad I did. Like most athletic shoes, they're sized 1/2 size larger than regular shoes. These are definitely my new favorites!\\r\\n\", 'Love these shoes!\\r\\nFinally! Total comfort! I love these shoes! I am on my feet all day long and can honestly say these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! I love Zappos and I now love Saucony shoes!\\r\\n', 'The GREAT white shoe -\\r\\nI think this is the greatest shoe that I have purchased yet. I have used Zappos for a couple of years. Great place to shop where else can you order shoes and send them back with free shipping. The Saucony Grid Omni walker is one of the better shoes that I have purchased. It is true to size and very comfortable. I put these on and away I went. No problems no discomfort. I tend to walk on the outside of my shoes and this shoe really helps to correct this problem. I highly recommend.\\r\\n', 'Very Comfy!!\\r\\nThese are very comfortable. I have a hard time finding comfortable shoes due to wearing steel toed shoes for over 20 years. These are great; I wore them shopping all day yesterday and my feet felt great. Some reviewers said they were sized small, others said they were true to size, so I went in the middle (1/2 size larger than I would normally order), and am very satisfied. I would buy these again, worth every penny for comfort!', 'Stability, supportive & kind of cute!\\r\\nFits very well to size. Takes my orthotic insert perfectly. Does a good job on absorbing impact with hill walking here in San Francisco. Visually very nice looking and are lighter than some other brands. Have only been using for four weeks, but will see how well they hold up.', \"My Favorite Shoe -\\r\\nI love the Saucony brand & wear them exclusively. I do wonder though about the quality anymore as they don't seem to last as long (I do work in a cafe as many as 8 or 9 hours a day) & they are the most comfortable shoe I own.\\r\\n\", 'Very comfortable shoe for exercise walking. The Omni Walker fit me in a 10-1/2, which is a 1/2 size up from my regular shoes. It offers lots of cushioning and toe room. It also fits in the heel, which is usually a problem for me. It is very well made and a top quality shoe. Since I am hard to fit, I am so delighted to finally find a comfortable walking shoe that fits me! Thanks, Zappos, for your quick delivery and easy ordering.', \"Enjoying the Comfort!\\r\\nI love to walk for my exercise routine; therefore, I must have a very comfortable walking shoe. I have a wide foot and was delighted that Zappos offered such a great selection. Saucony's Grid Omni Walker meets all my needs, especially where comfort is concerned. I would like it if the shoe maybe had a little more color or design but, to me, being able to walk at least two miles for my routine and feel no discomfort in my feet is the main issue.\\r\\n\", 'Save This Style -\\r\\nI wear sneakers all the time. I wish I could wear them when I dress up. I have a bad back and have had a heel spur. My shoes have to feel good all over. The Saucony Grid Omni Walker, as long as I can find them, are my new best friend. They feel great, look nice and surport my feet and legs and back. ***** 5 stars.', \"No more Achilles or plantar fascia pain!\\r\\nThis is my 3rd pair of Grid Omni Walker's and they are well worth the money. Why my third pair? I run 5 times a week and after 4-6 months, it's time for new cushions. They are true to size - my 8.5 is the same as my dress shoe size. I had trouble for a few years with Achilles tendonitis and plantar fasciitis. NO more with these shoes and Superfeet inserts. They proved excellent arch support to reduce those 2 other use issues. Some mornings I get up and put them on with my pajamas! My feet are so much happier in these shoes. They are more than walking shoes - I run in them and wear them to the gym, with plenty of lateral support for weight training and exercise classes. As always, Zappos gives great service at a good price.\\r\\n\", 'Great walking shoe -\\r\\nI really like the shoe. Very stable and comfortable. Nice roomy toe-box which Saucony are known for. It looks big, but is definitely worth wearing.', 'Comfort Zone -\\r\\nThese shoe are great,especially if you have bunions or other foot problems.', \"Saucony's grid Omni walker wide -\\r\\nI needed a walking shoe that was sturdier for winter than a mesh running shoe would provide. I tried the Saucony's grid in size wide 8 1/2. I have a lot of trouble finding shoes since my feet are square shaped and a size D. I also have hammer toes and extremely high arches. These shoes offered comfort and support of my high arches. I do wear a custom orthotic in these shoes. They have a wide and deep toe box and I can wear them all day with no problems.\\r\\n\", \"Comfy shoe -\\r\\nI was looking for a shoe that would accommodate an orthotic if necessary and would also provide a lot of support in the heel & arch. I ordered 2 different pairs and felt like the Saucony was much more what I was looking for. This shoe is very comfortable (even with a bone spur). My only disappointment was that I had to order a 1/2 size larger than normal as the toe box seemed very small on one foot and the shoe felt short. I returned the 1st pair - so easy, and ordered a new pair that night which arrived the next day (their shipping is SOOOO incredible). The credit for the 2 pairs I returned also came back quickly! After just having foot surgery to remove the bone spur, it is taking some adjustment to wear shoes again, but the overall support & cushioning feels great. I'm not even sure I will have to get orthotics again for pronation if they continue to be so supportive. My daughter says I need to get a shoe w/ some color, but since I'll be wearing them to work for a few weeks while recovering, I think they are just perfect. Thanks Zappos! I will continue to order from you all!\", 'I picked these shoes online months ago; what began as a possible birthday gift, then anniversary gift, finally became a Christmas gift. The shoes are awesome. I wear a 7 1/2 and ordered such and they are true to size. I wanted these shoes for an upcoming trip to Italy and I’ve worn them every day since Christmas day and they are awesome. Very comfortable, light but sturdy with great soles. I think they will meet my expectations exactly. A practical, yet stylish way to tread cobblestones. Thanks again to Zappos for practically instantaneous delivery.', \"Great Shoes and Great Service -\\r\\nI checked with Consumer Reports for walking shoes and they recommended the Saucony Grid Omni Walker. I couldn't find them in the surrounding area so I check on internet and found Zappos web site. I am 65, have had both knees replaced and had back surgery on July 2. The doctor recommended walking and exercise for my therapy so I wanted to get the best walking shoes available. I am not one to order online. I was amazed at the outstanding service and was shocked when I received them the following day.\\r\\nI highly recommend Zappos. Thanks\\r\\n\", \"The best walking shoe ever!\\r\\nThis is the first time I tried Saucony and I am so pleased with this shoe. It has everything I need for a good walking shoe. The fit is perfect and they are so comfortable. They are great for walking through a little water too as they are pretty water resistant. Love 'em!\\r\\n\", 'Saucony Grid Omni Walker -\\r\\nExcellent shoe. Good size toe box. Comfortable for long hours of walking.\\r\\n', \"Saucony Grid Omni Walker W -\\r\\nBefore I forget...Zappos is terrific. Great selection and purchase/return process-kudos to you. I am quite happy with this Saucony and will buy it again. I have a wide width. I've learned it is best to order w/w & a half size up. I put in between 5-6 walk/run miles a day (56yrs old) and use an insert and an extra inner sole. Because none of these shoes have sufficient cushioning. My toes seemed without it to grab and then really hurt and get blisters. Granted these devices make up for the 1/2 size larger but I found other shoes just didn't have enough room up front. Also, some other Saucony's I notice the tongue is getting shorter-what's with that? This one you can tie your laces and still grab enough of the tongue to pull it up. With the jury-rigging it is very comfortable, the heel stays in place (mine is narrow) and again I will buy again.\\r\\n\", 'These shoes are made for walking - I am a diabetic and I needed a good walking shoe that has comfort and support. I looked up on consumer reports recommendations of a good walking comfort shoe and they suggested this shoe and as usual they were right. I put the shoe on and wore it all day long. I can recommend this shoe. The size seemed to run true to size. There was a big toe box. I wear my arch supports in the shoe and they work fine.\\r\\n', 'Great support and comfort -\\r\\nThese shoes were great right out of the box - no rubbing or blisters and terrific support. My feet and legs feel so much better. As with most athletic shoes, I still feel the need for an insole, for cushioning at least - I wish manufacturers would put a good insole in to start with! Nevertheless, solid support and comfort.\\r\\n', \"These are the best - I have been a serious walker for over 30 years and have tried many different shoes. Easy Spirit was my shoe of choice until they discontinued the style that worked for me. While browsing Zappos I came across this shoe and thought I would give it a try. As soon as I put them on in the house I knew I had a winner, the arch was just right. The next day when I hit the pavement, I felt like I had an extra spring in my step. I'm a few weeks into these shoes and couldn't be more pleased. Hope this style is never discontinued. As for the look, I don't care about that, I'm not trying to make a fashion statement as I do my fitness walk. Thanks a bunch Zappos, for overnight shipping. You are awesome!\", 'I bought three pair -\\r\\nI work in a very busy emergency room. I looked in Consumer Reports to see what walking shoes had the highest ratings. This shoe was one of the top choices so I bought a white pair. I wore them the first day, all day long (I work 12 hr days). I was amazed how comfortable they were. I ended up buying the same shoe in black because I wear black pants to work and I also bought another white pair to play volleyball. I love them!!!

The Omni walkers are very close to the same fit. Very good support and comfort. I am very happy with them and will buy them again.\\r\\n', 'The shoe feels comfortable when being worn. However, I noticed that my feet still felt sore at the end of the day. Maybe I work too hard. ', 'Saucony Grid Omni Walker -\\r\\nThese shoes have saved me from the pain of plantar fasciitis and the pain of the Achilles heel tendon. Neither hurt since I started wearing these shoes. No more pain, no more limping.\\r\\n', \"Walking on air -\\r\\nThis Saucony shoe is just like the previous two I've worn (the Stabil line), superb in every way. It has just the right fit -- snug but not too tight -- and the leather uppers maintain their shape over time. Cushioned soles minimize jarring, there's none of the garish striping that's plastered all over most running shoes, and, most important, they provide strong support for my dropped arches.\\r\\nIn a shoe like this you could stand for hours without developing a limp! \", \"I'm stylin'\\r\\nA couple years ago I was given a pair of Saucony athletic shoes and have been a fan ever since. So, when it was time to buy another pair, I searched the web and ended up at ZAPPOS because they had the best and widest selection of Saucony's. I purchased 2 pairs. This pair fit at size 5, but the more fashionable pair was too tight on left foot, so I had to return for a 5.5. The return and exchange was the easiest I have experienced with any company. So, I say thanks for my GREAT shoes and service!\\r\\n\", 'Excellent walking shoes -\\r\\nGood cushioning, comfortable fit. I dislike shoes that are too heavy on my feet. This pair is light but still gives good support...a winning combination.\\r\\n', \"Extremely comfortable -\\r\\nA great shoe with lots of support. Did have to add insoles as the bottom felt a bit hard.\\r\\nJust not too stylish - but what's beauty compared to comfort?\\r\\n\", \"Good every day shoe, if you like to walk -\\r\\nI bought these so that I could wear them to work and have something already on if I get an opportunity to go for a walk during the day.\\r\\nGreat comfort. The look leaves a little to be desired -- I kind of feel like I'm wearing snow tires. But I'm not much for black shoes. So take that in context. :)\\r\\n\", \"Perfect walking shoe -\\r\\nThese are the most comfortable and stable walking shoes I've had. I walk in a very hilly neighborhood and take my walking seriously. It has been hard to find the perfect walking shoe. I like the fact that they are a neutral shade of white and silver.\\r\\n\", 'Very Comfortable Shoe!\\r\\nI love these shoes! I have a wide foot so I am very grateful for the wider width. They tend to make my foot look smaller than a size 10. The support is good and I am able to wear the shoes all day. Great for my tendonitis.\\r\\n', \"Best shoe for nurses!\\r\\nI've worn this style of Saucony for five years! I have trouble finding the plain white shoe (which is what we have to wear according to school uniform policy where I teach!). I first started using this shoe when I developed plantar fasciitis and it is wonderful! I've tried New Balance and can't wear those for 12 hours at a time!\\r\\n\", 'A real winner -\\r\\nI have this shoe in multiples, so that I can rotate it. I walk 3-6 miles every day as well as wear it to workout at the club. I have a wide foot and the wide size fits well. I wear a 6 1/2 shoe and \"size up\" to a 7 as advised by Saucony. My only negative is that they don\\'t last long - even after rotating them I have to replace them every 6 months. Maybe that is acceptable wear?', \"Wonderful comfort with Saucony Grid Omni Walker!\\r\\nI have tried shoes that cost more, but I now know that the cost doesn't mean comfort. This shoe is the only walking shoe that gets through 8 hours without pain to my feet or legs. I highly recommend the Saucony Grid Omni Walker for anyone who is on there feet for any length of time. LW\\r\\n\", 'I\\'ve been wearing these for about 1.5 months now. My walk to the bus is about 11 blocks each way, so they\\'ve been getting plenty of \"breaking in.\" The shoes offer some, limited arch support, but not as much as my custom orthotics. The fit is comfortable; snug but supportive. Heels are held and supported well; no pain with these shoes. They\\'re unventilated, so they\\'re warm as toast, sometimes too warm. The leather exterior sheds water and prevents wet feet on rainy walks.\\r\\nThe sole looks like it would offer excellent traction, but I\\'m sad to report it really doesn\\'t. When I walk to the office in the rain, I\\'m sliding all over the place. Brick pavement in front of the courthouse, slipping and sliding.

Comfortable. Thick cushion in the heel area.\\r\\n', 'I can always rely on Saucony sneakers. After trying several others I went back to the Saucony Walker and it fits me the best. The heel is a little looser than my last pair and hopefully I will get used to that. They are a little snug in the toe but just need to be worn in and stretched a little. Otherwise they are just what I wanted, they are comfortable on my feet and I can wear them all day without discomfort. I ordered white because the multi-colored ones are just a little bright for my tastes.\\r\\n', 'I normally wear a wide in Saucony but these were too snug. Sole support is good. Am going to try the Echelon to see if it will be \"the one\". I\\'ve worn the Integrity ST2 a few times and they are pretty comfortable, width is perfect, but sole support is not enough. Might be if worn with an orthotic.

I tried Easy Spirit and about a month or so into the shoe the plether on the right shoe cracked and after a good rain with puddles, I would step in a puddle and my sock got wet.\\r\\nSo when I went looking in the stores no one had my size 8.5 wide. Zappos took me through the Saucony Grid Omni Walker. I have flat feet so I have wear orthodics. I took out the insert that came with the shoe (easy peezy) and put in my orthodics and they work great in this shoe! I love it, it is a bit big but it makes up for it in arch support.\\r\\nI would definitely recommend this shoe to avid walkers and/or healthcare staff who are on their feet all day. A wonderful shoe, which you can't find in a store. \", 'I have two pairs of this shoe (one white and one black) that I absolutely love. They are comfortable and offer a lot of support. However, I have not been successful in purchasing another pair because the sizing is inconsistent. I normally wear 11.5, but have found on two occasions that the 11.5 was too large but the 11 was too small. The style has changed slightly since last year, and I suspect that Saucony has changed manufacturers. I wish Saucony would be more consistent with styling and sizing.', \"This isn't a bad shoe. It's got plenty of support for pronators, but it's just too wide and there is something weird about the last. It just doesn't hit my arch correctly. Probably fine for someone else. My size is 10.5 N. Fit more like a 10.5 M.\", 'I had to return the shoes. A 6.5 is just too big and a 6 would be too small. I did like the way that my walk improved wish that I could really wear them.', 'Love these shoes and have a couple in 8.5B. They worked out well, with great support, though a bit plain in the looks department.\\r\\nI thought I would try these in 8.5 wide because my last 2 toes on my right foot seemed to be a bit swollen and cramped this cold Winter.\\r\\nDid not work out, as the heel felt wider as well and felt like I was lifting out of the shoes.\\r\\n', \"These are not cute sneakers, although they serve my needs and I don't plan to wear them out in public. I do have to return them for a smaller size. I normally wear an 8.5, but lately my cranky feet have widened and find that going to size 9 helps. Totally unnecessary with these Sauconys, so I will be returning my 9 for an 8.5 when the 8.5 is available again. I bought these for strength training/weight lifting exercises, which I do at home. I don't want a lot of flexibility, I want stability and support, and these foot the bill. The toe box on the Medium (normal) width is quite roomy, so if you need what is considered a normal width (or narrow) you might find them way too wide. I have a foot that is getting wider, or a better way to put it is my feet are less willing to be squished into tight shoes due to bunions (and one of the toes can be painful). The wide toe box ensures that my toe bones and ball of foot don't get pinched or squished. They are super stable and have good support, so if you need a flexible walking shoe these might take some time to break in. I'm hoping they remain fairly stiff to support my weight lifting and strength training exercise routine. I kept the insoles in them to test it for a while but they were growing uncomfortable so I think I will swap them out for my Superfeet inserts. I'd like to get the Saucony Echelon LE2 for looks alone, but these Grid Omnis are more moderately priced. Since I won't be wearing them around town or at a gym so I don't care so much if they look cool enough to go out in public. The stability is really what I'm after.\", \"These are very comfortable shoes--my third pair (2 white, 1 black)! Not very stylish, sort of clunky, but comfort trumps style every time. I am always grateful for narrow shoes with room for Superfeet inserts. This pair had a small ink mark on it when I got it. I know Zappos would have replaced it, because they are terrific! But didn't seem worth the hassle of return and re-shipping. I'll probably be able to clean it off or cover it with polish. I love Zappos service and selection. \", \"These are great sneakers if you do a lot of walking or are on your feet all day. I am a nurse and they have been a great purchase. Even after 12 hour shifts, my feet still don't hurt!\", \"I like the shoe. I'm on my feet for long hours and the arch feels it is supported but the heel needs some padding or something. Not my favorite shoe. Exchanging for something else. \", 'Love the look for my need and the comfort, but they are too narrow for my wide feet and bunions. I ordered a 8 wide, but need wider. The New Balance 8 Wide was perfect.', 'Very comfortable from the moment I put them on and worked all day on my feet. I wish the arch support was better. The shoes are lightweight and that is a real bonus. I would recommend them. ', 'I have ordered these shoes several times in the past. Very comfortable and wear very well. My distain however, is with customer service, they never sent me a return label and after waiting 2 week I called customer service. The young lady was very rude and nasty. Will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.\\r\\n', 'Good walking shoe to address heel pain. One of the few brands available in a narrow width. Seems to give better heel support and cushioning than the Saucony Progrid Integrity ST 2.', 'Hi, shoe feels good but seems a little to high around the ankle for me...have not had it long enough to know if I will return it.', 'With this shoe you need to order 1/2 size larger than normal. Good walker. Service and shipping from Zappos.com... Awesome!', 'Average arch support. The heel box is not deep at all, so my foot seems to slide forward and my toes are getting smashed at the front of the shoe. Purchased the 8.5 wide, and they seem too narrow at the toe area. Am considering a return on this shoe. Buying the Vionics Orthaheel black walking sneaker to see if that style will work for me.', \"I bought these for walking, they are a little stiff but after my walks my feet don't hurt as usual. Not a lot to choose from color wise but style is fine.\", 'I always buy Saucony shoes. This particular pair feels too stiff and there is not enough arch support for me. I also miss the amount of cushion they used to put in the sole of their shoes. Good product but not like they used to be.', 'I absolutely love these shoes! This is actually my second pair as I wore my first pair out. I do 12 hour shifts and have feet issues, these are great! My only complaint is that they squeak. My first pair did it and now these have started too!', 'I absolutely love these shoes! This is actually my second pair as I wore my first pair out. I do 12 hour shifts and have feet issues, these are great! My only complaint is that they squeak. My first pair did it and now these have started too!', 'I liked the style and support but the shoe was too stiff. A shoe should be ready to wear right away without a break-in period.', \"I really wanted this shoe to work. I wore it around the house for a few days but finally had to admit to myself that they hurt my feet. I have special needs feet, so I guess I will keep on looking. Grateful for Zappos' easy return policy.\", \"The Saucony brand sneaker comes in the right wide width for my feet. I've ordered and returned several other brand named shoes where the wide width must have been for a narrower foot.\", 'I have used for 9 months, very comfortable from the beginning. Arch support is good, not great. Orthotics fit well. Tying is a problem due to knee issues, and loosening laces. I switched to elastic lock laces but when I slip them on the tongue gets twisted, but I wear them like this anyway. No discomfort, no blisters under the bunched up tongue.', \"I am a daily walker with arthritis and very narrow feet. Finding a shoe that fits my heel is never easy, nor much selection. I've been wearing asics in a narrow width, but they are a running shoe. I need more support and a wider toe box for swelling as well as a snug fit on my heel. The Saucony walker is certainly not the most stylish, but there is plenty of room for my toes and room for orthotics. The shoe laces are way too long. I still have to cinch them up quite a bit as the narrow width isn't as narrow as other shoes I've had. The shoes were comfortable on the first wear. The rubber soles have developed a slightly annoying squeak, but they are leather, the price is right, and I have a better walking experience.\"], 'num_helpful': [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4'], 'comfort': ['5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '3', '5', '5', '2', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '3', '5', '3', '5', '5', '3', '2', '4', '5', '5'], 'style': ['5', '5', '3', '5', '4', '2', '3', '3', '3', '5', '4', '4', '5', '2', '4', '3', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '5', '3'], 'size': ['4', '4', '3', '5', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', ' ', '3', '3', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '3', '3', '3'], 'width': ['4', '4', '3', '5', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', ' ', '3', '3', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '3', '3', '3'], 'arch': ['4', '4', '3', '5', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', ' ', '3', '3', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '3', '3', '3']}\n",

      "{'shoe': 'Saucony Grid® Omni Walker ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': [\"I was looking for a white tennis shoe that was wide and these fit the bill perfectly. I have very wide feet (10D) and I usually buy Easy Spirit Romy but the last pair I got wasn't very wide and it hit my little toe when I walked and was rubbing it raw. These are much wider and even cushy when you walk so they feel much better. They also have good arch support and are good looking. Of course Zappos customer service rocks!\", \"These are not attractive; they are making my knees feel much better so that I can walk longer with my dog. There isn't very much arch support but I guess the heavy bottom cushions the knee from the asphalt. I would buy again.\", \"This is a serious shoe that is fabulous IF you are an overpronator! If you are not an overpronator, you probably won't like it. I thought I am an overpronator and felt I had found the best shoe of all time for walking a Lab. It's very comfortable on my feet IF I don't lace it too tightly. However, it throws my skeleton out of alignment because my knees, hips, and ankles almost stop working after I've worn this shoe. I've not worn it now in over a week, and nothing hurts! I have not changed anything else, so I can only believe that this serious, industrial shoe is too much for me. I have now ordered the Saucony Integrity ST 2 and I believe it's going to be good for me. I've tried several Asics styles and they're definitely not as good for me as Saucony is. Saucony as a brand works for me, but NOT the Omni Walker. It's for overpronators, and it's clear when you look at it that it forces the feet toward the outside of the ankles. If you're an overpronator, you're gonna love it!!!\", 'I have wide flat feet and work in a hospital where I am on my feet many hours a shift.Finding a shoe that feels good all day is pretty darn hard but these Omni Walkers come as close to perfect as I have ever found. Only problem with them is they squeak with each step I take.', \"Based on some of the reviews, I bought a size a little larger - not sure if I should have done that because my heel slips (this is not uncommon for me as I FEEL like I have narrow feet but sizing charts tell me I don't). The shoes squeak when I walk and for the first few weeks, the knuckles on my toes were sore because the toe box is thick leather (unlike my last stretchier mesh). However, the shoes are very comfortable now and provide a lot of support. I walk 10-12 miles a week and have no problems with these shoes. I don't worry when it is colder or rainy as the shoes are warm. This may not be the greatest for a summer shoe but it's working great for the Fall.\", 'I wrote a review earlier about it throwing my foot to the side on the left foot. They are mostly comfortable, but unlike other people, sometimes I cannot really walk well after taking them off. So since so many give a sparkling review, why I bought them, I wanted to let people know what can happen. I need a shorter wider shoe. I have to buy two or more sizes up to get my width, so that is just an issue that I have had since I was a teenager. For me it was an over arch support, as in too much.', 'They are fairly comfortable, but the arch support in the left shoe is too long or something. It throws my foot to the side, which it already does. If you walk on the outside of your foot, these are not for you.', \"I'm a flight attendant and am allowed to wear tennis shoes but they have to be all white. Trying to find a pair of white tennis shoes is quite challenging but I'm happy to say Saucony rocks! At times I'm on my feet for 12 hours and we all know flying isn't always smooth. But I finally found a shoe that after a long day of being in the skies my feet don't hurt! I love my Saucony's. I also bought their ProGrid Integrity ST2's you'll love them too!\", 'Zappos is the best when it comes to ordering shoes online because of their customer service. I ordered these Saucony Grid Omni Walkers because they were rated #2 by Consumer Reports. I needed them for a trip to DC and a lot of walking. They were helpful and no blisters BUT the next day my heel was really hurting which means they did not have enough arch support, so if you have high arches like I do, replace the sock insert with an orthodic arch support.. now I have done this I am ready to try the next walking trip!', 'No wear these shoes primarily for my workouts at the gym. It took sometime to break them in because if the sturdy leather construction. I thought the toe box was a little small and would probably order a 1/2 larger next time. That said, I would purchase these shoes again. I am putting about three miles a day on these shoes and my feet/knees are doing just fine. Very good support, excellent shock absorption and all around well constructed.', 'I always wear a Saucony Omni shoe for the extra toe box space otherwise my toes will cramp. This is the first time I tried the Walker and love the style and comfort. This shoe has much more cushion than the regular Omni line. Would like to see more color options on the white shoe.', \"From the picture I wasn't too sure I would like the style of these shoes, but I decided to give them a try. The size was good, and there was plenty of room in the toe box, but the heel wasn't quite narrow enough for my foot. The heel slipped when I walked. The shoes also felt heavy and clunky and in my opinion didn't look very stylish. In the end, I went with the Saucony Integrity ST2s instead. They fit better and felt lighter on my feet.\", \"I bought the narrow (2A) and sized up 1/2 size which I usually do for athletic shoes. I should have sized up a whole size because the toe is slightly pointed which made my big toe sore. I am on my feet 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and these shoes were fairly comfortable and held up well for a year. They do not provide adequate arch support for a high arch. One thing that drove me crazy--they squeak. I don't think I'll buy them again only because of that squeak. If squeaky shoes don't bother you and you need a narrow, black leather shoe for work, these are good shoes for the price.\", 'Clunky and not terribly attractive, but comfortable and offer good ankle support, which is what I needed. Still used insoles with them. Was glad to find something that would work in a 10.5 narrow, which can be a challenge. ', \"I was looking for a stable walking shoe and had typically been wearing a running shoe for walking. This does the trick. It is stable with no real break-in time. It won't win any awards for fashion, but it is comfortable and works well with my orthotics.\", 'I wear wide. These shoes are not wide. I checked and rechecked. They said wide. The insole in left shoe was ¼\" or more from the end of shoe. I am returning the shoes after a long delivery. This is my first time for that.', 'Quality construction, good weight, balanced walking shoe. Slightly low over the toes, so if your feet are not bony, probably best to order 1/2 size larger.', 'This shoe is very comfortable. It is true to size. I have bursitis in my Achilles tendon and this is the only shoe out of 9 pairs that I tried that I could stand to wear. Thanks to Zappos wonderful easy return policy, I was able to find a new work shoe.', 'Purchased the walkers to use after recovering from a broken foot and wearing a walking boot for 9 weeks. The walkers are well made and true to size. I do find them a slightly \"heavy\" at times and not as light weight as some of my other sneakers. They are wearing well and were definitely a worthwhile purchase.', 'This shoe fits (available in narrow), is supportive and provides the cushioning I need. I have not had it long enough to know how durable it is.', 'This is a very comfortable shoe. However, the tongue of the shoe rubs against my ankle and hurts. No matter how I tried to readjust, it did not work for me. So sad.', \"These were just what I was looking for. After years of spending all day on my feet as a nurse, as well as a history of broken bones in both feet, I now have plantar fasciitis, weak heels, two different size feet, and bunions, as well as a very high arch. These shoes are a bit heavier than others I've had, but the support is good and my orthotic fits well in the shoe. There's a nice wide toe box to accommodate my poor weirdly shaped upper foot. Good looking as well. They are pricey, but I looked long and hard and these are by far the best I found.\", \"I've been in search of a comfortable and arch supportive shoe that doesn't rub for a long time. These are literally the most comfortable shoes I have EVER owned! For me the mark of a really good shoe (quality, construction, comfort), is when I don't notice that I'm even wearing them. There is no rubbing or discomfort to bring the shoes to mind while I wear them. I'm quite a heavy person, but these have so much support and padding, that it feels like I'm walking on a rubber sidewalk. Not the most stylish looking, but at least they are 100% black, so the style isn't that noticeable anyway. I'll probably buy a second pair as a backup soon, I like them so much!\", \"Shoe fit and comfort was excellent; however, the color of the shoe is not white. It's a silvery sheen color. The pictures are very deceiving. I needed all white shoes for nursing and this will not cut it.\", \"It fits great, though a little tight on my bigger foot, but otherwise very comfortable.

Other than the fit, the shoes looked well made, were relatively good looking for what they are and seem like a nice shoe for the right person. Thank you, Zappos for always making returns easy!', \"They're not bad. I ordered a size 10, very comfortable, but heavy. I wish they were lightweight, I think I would use them more.\\r\\nStyle-wise, I think they are a little clunky looking. I guess that is what you get when you want great support and comfort. \", 'These shoes are the best I ever wore. I have all sorts of foot problems and I put these on the first day and walked 4 miles. They are so comfortable I sent for a pair in black. Will not ever wear any other shoe. I have 7 pair of tennis shoes in my closet that I cannot wear, just wore a few times and they hurt my feet, but those are wonderful, never thought I would find a pair like this. Thank you.', \"So far I am not impressed. I walk all day and my feet aren't feeling much better. I'm not sure what is out there that would really work. I thought these would be the answer to my prayers. I wouldn't recommend them to someone who really needs to be on their feet all day.\", 'I had high hopes for this sneaker. The sneakers looked well made and felt comfortable except my toes. My problem is that the toe box was narrow and my toes rubbed on the side of the sneaker. I was disappointed because several of the reviews said the toe box was roomy. I did return them. I love, love, love Zappos.', 'I have extremely flat feet. My feet are literally like duck feet. When I wore these, my right shoe fit perfectly, but my left shoe felt really uncomfortable. It felt like the left shoe actually had an arch and the right shoe was perfectly molded. I would recommend this shoe for people that are barely overpronators. I returned this product.', \"Good solid shoe. However, it does aggravate my supination problem. Not sure if the arch is too high for my foot or what, but I feel my heel tipping outward. Tried a different insole, but doesn't really fix it. If you don't have this problem, I think this shoe will work for you.\", \"I love the Saucony pro grid stability shoes and I needed some black ones for work so I got this Omni. They are definitely a lot more narrow and I don't know if that has to do with it being leather but I traded a pair for a larger size. It feels good on my heel, sometimes I get planter fasciitis but it's definitely too narrow for my short wide toe area. Lucky they were not expensive but I'm really not happy with them but I've worn them a few times to where I don't think I could return them. I've been stuffing socks in the toebox to try to stretch it out, it might take a while.\", \"Honey, they made these narrower. Don't know why, but Wide isn't wide (and didn't fit glitchy foot or orthotics). Nicer traction, but not same shoe.\", 'I usually wear Brooks Addiction Walkers, size 6 1/2 Wide. I ordered the same size in the Omni Walker and found they not as wide or long as the Brooks. I will reorder in a 7 and 7W and see how the fit is.', \"This shoe did not work for me. The structure of the shoe, with it's strong arch support, created a lot of pressure on the ball of my foot, resulting in pain in that area after a half hour or so. I have experienced this type of pain with heels, but never athletic shoes. I guess no shoe works for every one. I'm very disappointed and will be giving these expensive shoes away.\", \"Arches too high! I have flat feet, and these shoe have too much support. After wearing the shoes for 6-8 hours, my back and knees really feel it. If it wasn't for the high arches, these shoes would get 5 stars.\", \"I like this shoe, however they make a weird noise (squishing sound) when I walk. I've been wearing them daily for several weeks now and the noise has not gone away. I would not order them ever again because of this. I would purchase other Saucony shoes because I've been happy with them in the past. Just not this specific model. Regarding Zappos...I have nothing but praise. They rock!\", 'The arch had a weird hard edge to it, with the left foot narrower than the right. They also seemed way smaller than 11.5. Closer to 11 or 10.5. These are going back.', \"I have to wear all black shoes at the hospital I work at. I've been wearing these about 6 months now and have to say that these aren't my favorite Sauconys. They just aren't as cushion-y as the rest of my others. I love Sauconys and will continue to buy them, but I believe there was another all black pair on Zappos that I'll buy before too long. These are just okay.\", 'Although did not try the shoe on, by simple inspection determined that the leather all around did not give too much \"breathing.\"', 'The shoe has a narrow toe area. I am used to wearing a 6.5 Wide (C) and this was narrow. I have tried many athletic shoes lately trying to get a good fit, and these were very nice, sturdy with a simple style, but just not wide enough in the toe area.', 'I have never had a problem with any shoes from Zappos, but these shoes squeaked and hurt my feet.', \"I ordered this sneaker. Was not impressed. Was stiff and seems narrower than the other Saucony's that I ordered in the past. I do like Saucony better than other brands though.\", 'These provide excellent cushioning, but the toe is narrow and the arch sits a bit far back in the shoe for me. I will return them. Progrid Intensity fits me better, so I hope they get more in in my size!', 'Minimal arch support. Shoe rubbed the front of both ankles. Unfortunately retturned.', 'Zappos is great, but this shoe is not. Okay on comfort, but after two weeks of wearing they are squeaking, announcing every step I take. Very annoying.', \"Good looking but even though it is a D width, the toe box is too tight.

The left one feels fine but the right one feels terrible. I tried three different pairs - regular and wide in two different sizes. In all of them, the arch support in the right shoe bit into the side of my foot making it painful to wear them. Too bad. I am going back to Keen shoes.\\r\\n', 'I was expecting good things for these shoes, and for most this might be it. For me I found the support to be excessive.

Unfortunately, the reviews let me to believe this shoe would be ok for heel spurs and bunions. That was not the case (for me). The shoe is a very hard shoe and was not at all comfortable for my feet. The heel back pressed right into where my heel spurs act up and there was no way I would be able to walk in these shoes. They were on and off my feet and back in the box so fast ... I did get some Vionic sandals in the same order and they have a great arch. For sneakers, I guess I will go back to my Saucony Sky Walk (they are a 'softer' built heel and memory foam foot bed) and keep searching for an alternative.\", 'This is my third pair of these shoes. Sadly they have changed them and they are no longer comfortable. The toe box is more narrow, and the insole hits in a funny way that causes foot pain.', \"These shoes are very narrow in the toe area. They also run about a half size too small. This is the first time that I had to return a pair of wide width shoes because they were too narrow for my feet. I am very disappointed that these didn't work for me because they appeared to have excellent support.\", 'I bought these based on the reviews. They are not as I expected. I wore these for a 13 hour shift on my feet and was in pain half way through the shift. I typically love Sauconys but these fell short for my needs. And I cannot even return them because I wore them. I am bummed. I am an assistant general manager at a casual dining restaurant so shock absorbing is key! The arch support was fine but the balls of my feet were in pain.', 'I bought this shoe in August, it was perfect. So I bought a 2nd pair in October, and what happened? The right shoe is too high at the ankle and rubs my ankle; the padding in that area has hard ridge like substances that rub against my foot. Very disappointed, maybe I received a defective shoe. The left shoe is perfect, so I am mystified...', 'Disappointed! The heel is too big, so my heel slops around. The arch support provided doesn\\'t support. Tried an insert, and that didn\\'t work.

I have a AAAA heel and narrow feet the entire length however in narrows this company simply made the last narrow all the way to toes...no one is that narrow in toes...seems comfortable for walking...have to return!', 'I love Saucony; however, this shoe runs a bit narrow even in the wide width. I bought a half size bigger to compensate, but now the arch is off. Would not recommend the wide for someone with a wide foot.

I bought them for work where I'm on the go for 8 hours minus 2 -15 min breaks and half hour lunch, so a about 7 hours on my feet. I read all the fantastic reviews and thought...wow, this must be the winner out of all the others I looked at ...but no. My feet hurt so badly after one day in them I nearly cried thinking I had to put them on again the next day.

The toe box is to large. Great heel support. Must return!', 'Gads, I am so disappointed. I read all the glowing reviews and thought this would be a great shoe. But not for me. It seems shorter than the shoes I am replacing although these are 1/2 size larger. Maybe the reason is the more pointed toe in this shoe. Also from the moment I put them on, my feet felt like they were on fire. Just not the shoe for me.', \"I am really unhappy with these shoes. They are uncomfortable and have no padding at all. Even when I put some extra Dr. Scholl's in them, they still are very restrictive and very uncomfortable. Like walking on concrete! If I had not worn them several times now, I would send them back.\", \"Oh, I loved these shoes! They fit beautifully (I like to have some room in the toe box, but not so much that I have to wear thick socks) and they bounced pleasantly as I walked, as if I were suddenly on a planet with a little less gravity. I have high arches, and these provided all the support I need. Best of all, they seemed well made and sturdy—real leather.\\r\\nBUT the honeymoon ended sometime in week 3, when a chunk of one heel fell off! I backtracked and retrieved the missing piece and was astounded to find it had a product number stamped on the side that had been previously attached to the shoe. Yes, folks, the sole of these babies was pieced together from multiple parts that couldn't hold it together for a month. I replaced them with another brand that's less comfortable.\", 'Shoes are too wide. Size is 10 narrow.

I have very wide feet with a high arch and instep. Most shoes hurt. I tried a pair of these and they hurt. There is no place for the shoe to expand when the foot swells. I will wear the ones that I have, hoping and praying Saucony changes their mind and starts making them again. I loved them.', 'A Mail Carrier Review...I need a good shoe to do my job. This is not that shoe. They hurt my legs less than a month into them and they squeak! Never will I buy them again.', 'Horrible shoes. Felt like they were forcing me to walk on the outersides of my feet. This caused a bad injury to my ankle. Would never buy this brand again. Tossed a these expensive shoes in the garbage after one week of wear. Sticking with Asics. Hoping my ankle heals soon.', \"I like the Saucony Jazz a lot, so I thought these Grid shoes might provide a sturdier version for snow etc. To my disappointment, the shoes were like putting rocks or heavy weights on the bottom of my feet.

      "ASICS GEL-Kayano® 24 \n",
      "{'shoe': 'ASICS GEL-Kayano® 24 ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': ['I am a pe teacher and I am on my feet all of the time, so Asics is my go to brand. I am a nimbus fan, but the past few years Asics has disappointed me.. The toe box is too small and the lining around the ankle only lasts a couple of months. I had to return the nimbus 19, they squeezed my toes and were very uncomfortable. I tried the kayano 23, but returned those as well and went back to wearing my old nimbus 15 and 16s. When I first saw the new Kayano 24, I was excited because they had an appearance similar to the nimbus 16s. They are a little narrower than the nimbus 16s, if you are comparing. I decided to give them a try, and I love them. They offer great arch support for my flat feet. They have an adequate amount of cushion, although they are not nearly as cushioned as the nimbus. Hoping they will change the style of the nimbus on the 20s, but until then I have found a pretty good replacement. I always order a half size larger in Asics. I gave 4 stars because of the colors offered, hopefully they will add more color choices.\\r\\n', 'Waaaay too small toe box. This is the 2nd time I have ordererd the \"new\" Asics styles and have been so disappointed in the much narrower toe box. I love the Gel Tech Walker Neo 4\\'s that I have had for 2 years, but since Asics had made new \"improvements\" and no longer makes the Walkers, I tried the Gel Kayano 23\\'s. The toe box was way too narrow, and I have a B width. I returned for the Gel Kayano 24\\'s, which was \"supposed\" to have a redesigned toe box because they had so many complaints about the 23\\'s. Same problem, AND this 24 pair has a distinct \"click\" when I step ONLY on my right shoe. It\\'s loud, too. I like that Asics is providing more neutral colored shoes and white ones, too, but WHY do they feel the need to mess with a proven design? After the Gel Tech Walker\\'s I am ordering today give out, I guess I will have to try another brand. Too bad Asics thinks that all change is good. VERY DISAPPOINTED, but Zappos could not make the return process any easier.\\r\\n', 'Why ASICS would you ruin these shoes and not fix them.. last year you cheapened them and made them shorter and narrower. Even the darn shoelaces are cheap. I just bought a pair of Brooks. They are better made and fit right. I have been buying ASICS for years but no longer. I wrote them last year but they don’t listen to their customers. I loved my old ASICS gel-kayano but unless the quality returns I will buy my shoes from others. I buy at least 3 pairs of running no shoes a year. But since they cheapened and ruined their products, I will not even look at them! The dark pink are new. The green and purple are the better made and better fit old style.\\r\\n', \"Asics must have listened to all the feedback about the Kayano 23s being too tight across the top of the foot because this version is much more comfortable. I'm not sure if the actual size is any wider because the shoe still does not have what I would consider a wide toe box. However, the material seems to provide more stretch, making for a more comfy fit. My toes didn't feel squeezed. The ankle/heel padding also feels better in this version. These still run small and have a close fit, so I ordered a half size up. The colors are minimal and classy (I tried the gray), and the shoes would appeal to those wanting the more minimal athleisure look. Unfortunately, I have a severe overpronation problem (posterior tibial tendon dysfunction), and these just didn't seem to provide enough stability for me. If you need a strong stability shoe, you might want to look elsewhere.\\r\\n\", \"I have worn ASICS for years and NB. However, recently I developed plantar fasciitis and was told by the foot doc to stop wearing my NB which had no support or sturdiness. So I bought these after trying on about a dozen other pairs of shoes. It's probably the most I have spent on running shoes but they seem worth it to me. The doc basically took my NB and twisted them around to make his point. You can't do that with these ASICS which have alot of all around support. I like that the laces also stay tied and tight. I love black running shoes because I can also travel with them or use them when I am in business clothes and not look like a total dork. I just wish the sole was all black without any of the white. Great toe box, width and length for a 9.5. It's helped keep my left foot stable and recover from this nagging plantar fasciitis. I use these for walking globally for travel and running.\\r\\n\", \"I love that Asics finally offered a running shoe in white. I am so tired of all the crazy, hideous color combos of recent years. I have worn Kayano, GT-2000 and Gel Nimbus over the past 15 years. I think these are my favorite Kayanos yet. They are way lighter than past Kayanos, so not nearly as clunky. I love the white and may order the blue as well. I use these for long dog walks and power walking at OrangeTheory. I have podiatrist-made orthotics which provide a lot of cushioning so can't really comment on cushion level without those.\\r\\n\", \"I've worn Kayanos in the past, but these were narrower than marked. They have an hour-glass type shape, and it didn't work with socks.\", \"My first pair of Kayanos was the 18 model. By far, the best pair of shoes ever. Great fit, great support. I then bought 20s, not as good as 18s. I've been looking for a worthwhile Kayano since the 20, but will continue to wait. The 24s I ordered had a very snug toe box, were hard on my heels, and the left shoe had support in an unnatural position. Not particularly cushioned. So disappointing, as I literally wore my 18s to shreds...\\r\\n\", \"I go through a lot of running shoes - about 2-3 pairs a year (and yes, I ONLY use them for running). These shoes have always been my go to for teh past ten years. I've tried to venture out and I always come back.\\r\\nIf you're a runner, I highly recommend trying Asics if you haven't yet. Get properly fitted though. There's a reason why there are different models. Everyone's feet are different.\\r\\nI have: high arches, wide feet, run about 40-50 miles a week during non-marathon training. These babies hold up. I can get about 400-500 miles on each pair and still am able to hold onto them for that future Ragnar I'm planning on doing.\\r\\nThey're comfortable; they're well made; they're sturdy. The 23 and this 24 model happen to have a tighter toe-compartment than previous models, but still fit well. I think for the standard foot you will be fine. It did take some getting used to for me when I bought the 23, but only because I was so used to the older models.\\r\\nGreat shoe.\\r\\n\", 'Really great shoe for walking. I’d recommend wearing high or padded socks to protect your heel if sneakers rub your heel. I have that problem with most sneakers and did with this pair but easily solved with new socks. Love this shoe!\\r\\n', \"I've had I think 6 generations of Kayanos. The 22 & 23 were disappointing compared to earlier versions. The 24 seems better although cushioning seems to be a bit less. Unlike others I found that I still needed 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size, just like previous Kayanos. I'm also happy they have less bright colors available.\\r\\n\", 'I was pleasantly surprised when I put these on and wore them. They are very comfortable and I have no issue.\\r\\n', \"Feels every bit as good as all of the many Gel Kayano's that I have bought for the last 20 years. I would describe my feet as thin to medium. Great style, & my 6 year old said I look younger! Loving the grey/coral color, very modern.\\r\\n\", '20-30 mile / week runner with planters fasciitis. This pair of Asics made me a huge Kayano fan. Just ordered my second pair. I did feel that they didn’t last as long as other Asics Gel’s. But they are my favorite in comfort and feel. I am an avid runner and Orange Theory fanatic aka cardio junkie. My feet are very important to me!\\r\\n', 'I absolutely LOVE these shoes! In my opinion the shoes weren’t as comfortable when I first put them on but once I broke them I feel like they are the most comfortable pair of shoes I’ve owned. I love the style and type of fabric used on the shoes. You can’t tell from the picture but they actually have a cool textured look.\\r\\n', 'Much improvement over the 23’s. Wider toe box. Good heel support for Achilles tendon and plantar fascia. This is my second pair of 24’s. My first pair only lasted about 275 miles. Usually I can get an easy 400+ miles out of the kayano.\\r\\n', 'I have severe overpronation and these shoes provide the support I need to workout comfortably and safely. These shoes are also aesthetically pleasing. I am planning on buying these pair in pink as well.\\r\\n', 'A very supportive shoe, but I need a roomier toe box for my ageing feet. Also, my foot slid to the front after a few steps, leaving room at the heel and cramming my toes in the front - felt like the cushioning under the heel was too high.\\r\\n', \"Great work shoes! I tried some actual work shoes, but they were just too heavy and clunky. These Asics are lightweight and SO comfortable right out of the box! I love them! And I love Zappos! It's the only online shoe store I use. Great customer service, outstanding return policy, as in free! Can't ask for more than that!\\r\\n\", 'Loved the blue color but had to return because they did not fit. I tried 9.5 and 10 and both seemed to be too tight and stiff. The toe box was also quite tight.\\r\\n', 'Kayano 24 is so much better than 22 and 23. The material is soft and stretchy (very similar to Skechers Burst series soft knit fabric). The fit is great and comfortable. I have size 9 for kayano 22 and 9 1/2 for Kayano 23. For 24, I can go back to size 9.\\r\\n', 'I absolutely love these shoes. This is my second pair of Gel-Kayanos and I am very impressed with the quality and comfort!\\r\\n', \"I love Asics Gel Kayano and this is my third pair. For the Gel Kayano 19's I always wore 9.5 but in the 24's I need to wear 10's. They work great with my orthotics, and the gray color is a nice neutral that isn't sterile white.\\r\\n\", 'Comfortable out of the box.

      "ASICS GEL-Kayano® 24 \n",
      "{'shoe': 'ASICS GEL-Kayano® 24 ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': ['I am a pe teacher and I am on my feet all of the time, so Asics is my go to brand. I am a nimbus fan, but the past few years Asics has disappointed me.. The toe box is too small and the lining around the ankle only lasts a couple of months. I had to return the nimbus 19, they squeezed my toes and were very uncomfortable. I tried the kayano 23, but returned those as well and went back to wearing my old nimbus 15 and 16s. When I first saw the new Kayano 24, I was excited because they had an appearance similar to the nimbus 16s. They are a little narrower than the nimbus 16s, if you are comparing. I decided to give them a try, and I love them. They offer great arch support for my flat feet. They have an adequate amount of cushion, although they are not nearly as cushioned as the nimbus. Hoping they will change the style of the nimbus on the 20s, but until then I have found a pretty good replacement. I always order a half size larger in Asics. I gave 4 stars because of the colors offered, hopefully they will add more color choices.\\r\\n', 'Waaaay too small toe box. This is the 2nd time I have ordererd the \"new\" Asics styles and have been so disappointed in the much narrower toe box. I love the Gel Tech Walker Neo 4\\'s that I have had for 2 years, but since Asics had made new \"improvements\" and no longer makes the Walkers, I tried the Gel Kayano 23\\'s. The toe box was way too narrow, and I have a B width. I returned for the Gel Kayano 24\\'s, which was \"supposed\" to have a redesigned toe box because they had so many complaints about the 23\\'s. Same problem, AND this 24 pair has a distinct \"click\" when I step ONLY on my right shoe. It\\'s loud, too. I like that Asics is providing more neutral colored shoes and white ones, too, but WHY do they feel the need to mess with a proven design? After the Gel Tech Walker\\'s I am ordering today give out, I guess I will have to try another brand. Too bad Asics thinks that all change is good. VERY DISAPPOINTED, but Zappos could not make the return process any easier.\\r\\n', 'Why ASICS would you ruin these shoes and not fix them.. last year you cheapened them and made them shorter and narrower. Even the darn shoelaces are cheap. I just bought a pair of Brooks. They are better made and fit right. I have been buying ASICS for years but no longer. I wrote them last year but they don’t listen to their customers. I loved my old ASICS gel-kayano but unless the quality returns I will buy my shoes from others. I buy at least 3 pairs of running no shoes a year. But since they cheapened and ruined their products, I will not even look at them! The dark pink are new. The green and purple are the better made and better fit old style.\\r\\n', \"Asics must have listened to all the feedback about the Kayano 23s being too tight across the top of the foot because this version is much more comfortable. I'm not sure if the actual size is any wider because the shoe still does not have what I would consider a wide toe box. However, the material seems to provide more stretch, making for a more comfy fit. My toes didn't feel squeezed. The ankle/heel padding also feels better in this version. These still run small and have a close fit, so I ordered a half size up. The colors are minimal and classy (I tried the gray), and the shoes would appeal to those wanting the more minimal athleisure look. Unfortunately, I have a severe overpronation problem (posterior tibial tendon dysfunction), and these just didn't seem to provide enough stability for me. If you need a strong stability shoe, you might want to look elsewhere.\\r\\n\", \"I have worn ASICS for years and NB. However, recently I developed plantar fasciitis and was told by the foot doc to stop wearing my NB which had no support or sturdiness. So I bought these after trying on about a dozen other pairs of shoes. It's probably the most I have spent on running shoes but they seem worth it to me. The doc basically took my NB and twisted them around to make his point. You can't do that with these ASICS which have alot of all around support. I like that the laces also stay tied and tight. I love black running shoes because I can also travel with them or use them when I am in business clothes and not look like a total dork. I just wish the sole was all black without any of the white. Great toe box, width and length for a 9.5. It's helped keep my left foot stable and recover from this nagging plantar fasciitis. I use these for walking globally for travel and running.\\r\\n\", \"I love that Asics finally offered a running shoe in white. I am so tired of all the crazy, hideous color combos of recent years. I have worn Kayano, GT-2000 and Gel Nimbus over the past 15 years. I think these are my favorite Kayanos yet. They are way lighter than past Kayanos, so not nearly as clunky. I love the white and may order the blue as well. I use these for long dog walks and power walking at OrangeTheory. I have podiatrist-made orthotics which provide a lot of cushioning so can't really comment on cushion level without those.\\r\\n\", \"I've worn Kayanos in the past, but these were narrower than marked. They have an hour-glass type shape, and it didn't work with socks.\", \"My first pair of Kayanos was the 18 model. By far, the best pair of shoes ever. Great fit, great support. I then bought 20s, not as good as 18s. I've been looking for a worthwhile Kayano since the 20, but will continue to wait. The 24s I ordered had a very snug toe box, were hard on my heels, and the left shoe had support in an unnatural position. Not particularly cushioned. So disappointing, as I literally wore my 18s to shreds...\\r\\n\", \"I go through a lot of running shoes - about 2-3 pairs a year (and yes, I ONLY use them for running). These shoes have always been my go to for teh past ten years. I've tried to venture out and I always come back.\\r\\nIf you're a runner, I highly recommend trying Asics if you haven't yet. Get properly fitted though. There's a reason why there are different models. Everyone's feet are different.\\r\\nI have: high arches, wide feet, run about 40-50 miles a week during non-marathon training. These babies hold up. I can get about 400-500 miles on each pair and still am able to hold onto them for that future Ragnar I'm planning on doing.\\r\\nThey're comfortable; they're well made; they're sturdy. The 23 and this 24 model happen to have a tighter toe-compartment than previous models, but still fit well. I think for the standard foot you will be fine. It did take some getting used to for me when I bought the 23, but only because I was so used to the older models.\\r\\nGreat shoe.\\r\\n\", 'Really great shoe for walking. I’d recommend wearing high or padded socks to protect your heel if sneakers rub your heel. I have that problem with most sneakers and did with this pair but easily solved with new socks. Love this shoe!\\r\\n', \"I've had I think 6 generations of Kayanos. The 22 & 23 were disappointing compared to earlier versions. The 24 seems better although cushioning seems to be a bit less. Unlike others I found that I still needed 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size, just like previous Kayanos. I'm also happy they have less bright colors available.\\r\\n\", 'I was pleasantly surprised when I put these on and wore them. They are very comfortable and I have no issue.\\r\\n', \"Feels every bit as good as all of the many Gel Kayano's that I have bought for the last 20 years. I would describe my feet as thin to medium. Great style, & my 6 year old said I look younger! Loving the grey/coral color, very modern.\\r\\n\", '20-30 mile / week runner with planters fasciitis. This pair of Asics made me a huge Kayano fan. Just ordered my second pair. I did feel that they didn’t last as long as other Asics Gel’s. But they are my favorite in comfort and feel. I am an avid runner and Orange Theory fanatic aka cardio junkie. My feet are very important to me!\\r\\n', 'I absolutely LOVE these shoes! In my opinion the shoes weren’t as comfortable when I first put them on but once I broke them I feel like they are the most comfortable pair of shoes I’ve owned. I love the style and type of fabric used on the shoes. You can’t tell from the picture but they actually have a cool textured look.\\r\\n', 'Much improvement over the 23’s. Wider toe box. Good heel support for Achilles tendon and plantar fascia. This is my second pair of 24’s. My first pair only lasted about 275 miles. Usually I can get an easy 400+ miles out of the kayano.\\r\\n', 'I have severe overpronation and these shoes provide the support I need to workout comfortably and safely. These shoes are also aesthetically pleasing. I am planning on buying these pair in pink as well.\\r\\n', 'A very supportive shoe, but I need a roomier toe box for my ageing feet. Also, my foot slid to the front after a few steps, leaving room at the heel and cramming my toes in the front - felt like the cushioning under the heel was too high.\\r\\n', \"Great work shoes! I tried some actual work shoes, but they were just too heavy and clunky. These Asics are lightweight and SO comfortable right out of the box! I love them! And I love Zappos! It's the only online shoe store I use. Great customer service, outstanding return policy, as in free! Can't ask for more than that!\\r\\n\", 'Loved the blue color but had to return because they did not fit. I tried 9.5 and 10 and both seemed to be too tight and stiff. The toe box was also quite tight.\\r\\n', 'Kayano 24 is so much better than 22 and 23. The material is soft and stretchy (very similar to Skechers Burst series soft knit fabric). The fit is great and comfortable. I have size 9 for kayano 22 and 9 1/2 for Kayano 23. For 24, I can go back to size 9.\\r\\n', 'I absolutely love these shoes. This is my second pair of Gel-Kayanos and I am very impressed with the quality and comfort!\\r\\n', \"I love Asics Gel Kayano and this is my third pair. For the Gel Kayano 19's I always wore 9.5 but in the 24's I need to wear 10's. They work great with my orthotics, and the gray color is a nice neutral that isn't sterile white.\\r\\n\", 'Comfortable out of the box. Comfort and fit you expect with asics.\\r\\n', \"I still like the Gel Kayano 21s best, which I can no longer find in my size. These hurt my soles the first few times I wore them but are breaking in now, so I'm hopeful they'll be better. I've worn Gel Kayanos for 10+ years.

I ordered my regular size and they are perfect,\\r\\n', \"I have bad knees, so I need running shoes with good support. I ordered a bunch of running shoes (New Balance, Nike, Addidas, Asics, etc.) these included, for a side-by-side comparison at home. Testing all of these out was like a mini workout. The verdict: while these were in my top 3, they did not make the final cut. I went with ASICS GEL-Nimbus?® 19 instead - best cushioning by far. Gel-Nibus 18 would've been my second choice.\\r\\n\", 'I ordered the Gel 24 and Gel 22 (from Amazon). The Gel 24 were stiff and uncomfortable compared to the 22 and mAde my feet hurt instantly. The Gel 22 were far better but they are definitely a heavier sneaker compared to my Nike Fusion.\\r\\n', 'I bought these for my daughter in a narrow for track as she has very narrow feet. The moment she tried them on she was thrilled. She said she has never worn shoes that fit so well.\\r\\n', \"Great shoe! But didn't need them after all so returning. Jennifer Garner actually owns a pair!\\r\\n\", 'I bought these because of reviews for plantar fasciitis and I loved them so much I bought a second pair. They’re amazing and totally worth the money!\\r\\n', \"These are my go-to athletic shoes. I have a fairly wide foot, and even with the changes Asics have made in the Kayanos over the years, these are still the most comfortable for me. I've been wearing Kayanos since 2010!\\r\\n\", 'I really liked these. Comfortable, nice looking. But unfortunately they squeak a lot when I walk in them.\\r\\n', 'Sending these back because there was no arch support. They fit true to size and look fine. I also ordered the Asics GT-1000 6 and they have arch support and look great so I’m keeping those.\\r\\n', 'This pair runs true to the regular sneaker size. So, I am normally a size 9, in most sneaker brands, I am a 9.5. This pair of Asics runs true to the sneaker sizing. More narrow, than older shoes. I am not sure about performance, but does not appear to have the layers of various rubber and gel outer soles as older models. For this reason, I am skeptical of keeping this pair.\\r\\n', 'This is a comfortable shoe however the new design completely takes away the support on the back of your heel so no matter how tight you tie the laces when you walk your heel slides up.. bring back the Gel-Kayano 22\\r\\n', \"I have been wearing Kayano's for years and love them. This is the first time I've had an issue but the toe box on the right foot is tight. I'm getting blisters on my toe. I have never experienced this before and it is disappointing.\\r\\n\", 'I ordered a half size up as the 8.5 was too small. The toe box is very tight with this shoe, ultimately becoming uncomfortable. They are nice looking, but not good for long walks. I will stick with my narrow New Balance.\\r\\n', 'Great shoe with one major exception. The stiff heal brace around the back of the shoe is too clunky & it makes my foot slide forward no matter how tight the shoe is tied. Must return.\\r\\n', \"The Asics just do not fit like they used to, seem not very well made. i have worn Asics for over 10 years now i can't find one that fits properly.\\r\\n\", 'I have been wearing the Gel Kayano for many years. Unfortunately, they just don’t fit the same. The toe box is too narrow and overall uncomfortable. I am disappointed that the shoe I could always count on to fit and feel good is no longer my “go to” shoe.\\r\\n', 'I was hopeful after reading reviews that this model would be better than the past few. I love my pair from several years ago but have had several models since that continually feel much more narrow even after ordering half size larger and wide with (which the old pair was not). Unfortunately, I\\'ll be switching brands as this shoe is no longer my \"go to\" for working out.\\r\\n', 'Beautiful shoe for about 15 minutes into my workout when the sole split open. I wore them once. Sad quality for the price. Returned.\\r\\n', \"I had such high hopes for the GEL_Kayano 24s as the 23s were (are) my all time favorites. I remember the first time I tried on the 23s I felt like I was walking on clouds. The 24s feel like I'm walking on cement. The arch support is non-existent and has made my plantar fasciitis flare up terribly. I like the color choices and style but beyond that the shoes are awful for people who need support and cushioning. Just avoid these shoes. Period.\\r\\n\", 'Too narrow across foot. Disappointed that asics has changed the width since the Kayano 21. Have to go up a full size and then the rest of the shoe is just too big. Very disappointed that I will have to find a new brand of shoes for my pronation issue.\\r\\n', \"This shoe looks really great on. It's not bulky at all, but it does run a little small. I usually wear a 9, but had to go up to 9.5 in these for the length and they are still not wide enough. The toe box is not very roomy at all and the top of the shoe seems to have a low profile, making it tight where the laces start from the toe area. The heel has great cushioning, but under the ball of the foot feels very hard. The shoes are also a bit stiff compared to my other Asics. I bought these to help with plantar fasciitis but they are not cushioned enough. There is also pretty much NO arch support. I am not a runner, but I usually wear running shoes for the comfort. I think I am going to have to return these because they are just not comfortable enough for the price. Why does it have to be so hard to find a shoe that looks AND feels good?\\r\\n\", \"I'm a woman without a running shoe. I have been wearing Asics for 15 years, always buying their top lines, including both Kayanos and the Mataruns. What gives, Asics? These Kayanos and last year's, too, are WEIRDLY narrow across the top of the toe box area, like immediately painful. My feet are not abnormally wide or anything; I've never had this issue before Asics redesigned this shoe. It's bizarre. They have got to fix this issue. Until then, I literally have no clue what running shoe I can truly count on anymore. Sad!\\r\\n\", \"I dread buying new walking shoes because the shoes I bought the last time are never available. I've had several earlier versions of the Gel-Kayano and they were great. This one, however, seems like a completely different shoe. It's narrower, the toes are more pointed with less toe room, the quality seems to have decreased. I will never understand why these shoe companies change a style so drastically. Finding new shoes shouldn't be such an ordeal and waste so much time.\\r\\n\", 'This style has been my favorite for years but the new styling did something to the footbed that adds instability to the performance.

I have narrow feet and overpronate, but have tried to stop relying on maximum motion control shoes and let my feet and ankles get stronger so that I can use the muscles and tendons I have without pain.\\r\\nI decided to switch to the Asics Kayano instead.

      "{'shoe': 'ASICS Gel-Kahana® 8 ', 'gender': 'Female', 'reviews': ['Really disappointed--have been wearing Kahanas for years as a general running and every day shoe, but these are longer and narrower. Have to return them because my toes feel SQUISHED! The design is slightly different and just not going to work for me. ', 'Too narrow for me! Nice shoes, wish they worked out.', \"Ordered these for two reasons....1 - LOVE Asics and 2 - needed trail running shoes! These should far exceeded my expectation! Comfortable from the moment I put them on, zero 'break in' time required and they have great grip when summiting elevation. Very pleased with this purchase and price! Thank you Asics & Zappos!\", 'Love these sneakers. They seem to run smaller in the toe box than previous models (I have the Kahana 6 and it was wider in the tox box). ', 'Had the previous shoe in this style, in fact I liked them so much I bought two pairs. However, for some reason, Aspics changes the fit with each new release, and these did not fit at all! The shoe is narrower, and the arch seemed to be farther back, toward the heel. So there began the long search for a comfortable, cushioned shoe. Found it in Brooks Ghost 9GTX. Stop changing the fit of these styles, Asics! Who has the time to try every shoe in your line to find the one that fits this year?', 'I have heel spurs and Plantars Fascitis, and these shoes are great to help with both of those problems. My orthotics fit in them perfectly, and allows me to be on my feet for 12 hours a day. ', \"I'm obsessed with my new sneakers! There was no breaking-in period; the first time I wore them, I felt as if I was walking on clouds. I had previously owned a different model of ASICS sneaker (Gel-Contend), which I'd liked, so I went for ASICS again. I had been concerned about the reviews saying this shoe was narrow in the toes, but it feels perfectly comfortable and roomy to me. (I wear a women's size 12 and my feet are medium width, maybe erring toward the narrow side. But I experienced no pinching at all.) Also, I LOVE the look of the shoes. And the slight ridging in the laces not only looks cool but keeps me from having to tie double knots, which I ALWAYS have to do. Five stars!\", 'This shoe is perfect for my foot. Great support , true to size and width, lightweight and breathable. I walk 7-8 miles daily and this shoe is my go to walking shoe.', 'I love the ASICS Gel-Kahana and have been wearing this style for years. I live near great hiking trails and these shoes are perfect for on and off road! This new version \"8\" is too marrow for my average size foot and there\\'s no option to order wide. There are so many things I love about this shoe; unfortunately, the new narrow design may keep me from continuing to buy this shoe. ', \"The Kahana 8 is narrower than the Kahana 7. With the Kahana 7 I ordered 1/2 size up from my normal street size. For the Kahana 8 I had to order a full size up from my street size.\\r\\nI run around 20 miles a week and like to hike as well. To be honest, I'm going to send these back. I have narrow feet, but these are just a tad too narrow and feel uncomfortable in the arch area. They are hitting the inside of the arch and causing some pain.\\r\\nI have struggled with plantar fasciitis for the past year and the Kahana 7 allowed me to begin running and hiking again with a minimal amount of pain. I have narrow feet and overpronate, but have tried to stop relying on maximum motion control shoes and let my feet and ankles get stronger so that I can use the muscles and tendons I have without pain.\\r\\nI decided to switch to the Asics Kayano instead. It is not a trail shoe, but it seems a bit wider in the forefoot than the Kahana while offering some amount of stability and cushioning. It also runs short, so I ordered a full size up from my street shoe size.\\r\\nI would say that if you have a wide foot you might try a different trail shoe, as these may not work for you.\", 'Disappointed in this shoe, I have an old pair of Kahana style shoes and love how they fit. I have numerous Asics all in size 9, fit perfect. This pair also purchased in size 9 felt small in the toebox and tight overall even after loosening the laces ALOT. May try a half size up or a different style; loss of consistency in sizing, hopefully not a sign of loss of quality with Asics.', 'I absolutely love these shoes. I have owned Asics for many years. I love he nimbus, but thought I would give these a try and I am glad I did. They feel and look great! I get compliments all the time on the way they look, but most importantly they feel o good on my feet! ????\\r\\n', 'I loved these shoes from the minute I put them on.

Nice balance between being sturdy enough for trail running and not too rigid. Good tread grip, haven't slipped running on rocky muddy pacific NW trails all winter.

      "{'shoe': 'Nike Air Zoom Wildhorse 4 ', 'gender': 'Male', 'reviews': [\"I've been running in these since the first version of the Wildhorse. I loved version 1 and 3. I believe I've owned 6 pairs across the difference versions. The new version 4 is very similar to 3 except for one critical difference for a foot with a higher instep like mine. The new stretch spacer mesh over the the top of shoe makes it too tight and constricting without a way to relieve any of the pressure on the top of the foot (i.e. just loosing your laces a little bit). A great shoe very similar to version 3, but just be aware of the subtle changes. The tongue is now attached into more of a sock like fit, but i think it's still loose enough that this isn't contributing to the problem in my case. Hopefully (for me) they alter it a bit next time again. \", 'With a fairly high arch, these were a bit tight across the top of my foot. Decent arch support and good fit all around.\\r\\n', 'Nice shoe. I purchased these for golfing in dry conditions. Works well on the course. Runs a bit small, I have 3 current pairs of Nike running shoes at 10.5. Size 11 in these fit much better than 10.5. Comfort is a bit stiff, but nothing an insole cant fix.\\r\\n', 'Coolest shoe ever, but definitely for the trail and not merely a running shoe for comfort and walking around.\\r\\n', \"One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. However, design did not hold up against 4 hikes. Rocks sliced a lace loop. Also wore shoes while golfing and they make for a great gold option. Just be careful if hiking or trail running not to brush up against rocks.\\r\\n\", 'Great fit. Very Comfortable\\r\\n', 'Unique style. On my feet all day for my job. Very comfortable. Many compliments on the colors and unique style. Would certainly recommend for terrain and in-door daily usage.\\r\\n', 'Awesome shoe. Am buying another pair. Was a half size too small for me. But exactly what i want\\r\\n', 'A little narrow\\r\\n', 'Would recommend to anyone, truly comfortable shoe.\\r\\n', 'Excellent trail running shoes. No break in time and great grip.\\r\\n', 'Great shoe. Comfortable and stylish.\\r\\n', 'Great kicks... I get compliments on them all the time. Comfortable on pavement and off-road. Highly recommended.\\r\\n', 'Incredible fit and feel, despite being a little tight. Cradles the foot and gives great heel support, AWESOME running shoe, especially if you have a flat foot as I do. A+++\\r\\n', 'this is the second version of this trail running shoe - and I love them! such grip and support!! a great shoe!', 'These are very comfortable. The tread is awesome. Really good for hiking and trail running.', \"I read that this shoe could run smallish. That is not the case. I wear a 11.5-12 depending on the shoe. A 12 felt a tad big. I loved the shoe so much I bought both. This is the best Nike shoe I have ever bought. It's got looks, performances, reliability, and comfort. Nike nailed this shoe for the trail running audience. Gonna use this for the Spartan race in June. Love this shoe!\", \"A rugged and fast shoe, if it works for your foot (isn't that the case for all shoes?).\\r\\ntl;dr:\\r\\nWhat I like - Not overly-aggressive arch support, rugged, stable.\\r\\nWhat I dislike - Ventilation, outsole traction, toe box space.\\r\\nArch/Instep: Both the instep and the arch are much flatter than other trail shoes I've tried. If you have high arches and insteps, this shoe probably won't fit great unless you loosen the laces.\\r\\nToe Box: The Wildhorse 4 offers a moderate amount of toe box clearance, though not nearly the clearance of an Altra. While I've had very few problems with my toes last season, I could feel my toes beginning to encroach on one another on anything longer than 15 miles.\\r\\nOutsole: Nike's own outsole, while rugged, is a bit too hard for the terrain I use them on, which is shale or slick rock. They don't inspire the same level of confidence as a lugged Vibram outsole. They feel a little squirmy on steep downhills, due to the rockplate rigidity and the hardness of the outsole. When the outsole lugs are new, they tend to make trail debris more airborne than normal, requiring me to run trail gaiters on faster efforts. The outsole is wider, which helps when I start getting tired on long runs.\\r\\nMidsole: Great cushion without it sapping hard uphill efforts. Not much to say here, though after about 300 miles, I was able to feel it breaking down.\\r\\nInsole: For some reason, the insoles don't agree with me. I use Darn Tough socks, which I've trained with for about 2 years, and the insole texture is too rough for my foot. Anything over 10 miles and it feels like the ball of my foot has been belt sanded. I swapped the insoles out, and haven't had any other issues.\\r\\nUpper: The upper is tough. I only started seeing the expected tear from flexing the first metatarsal after about 350 miles. Unfortunately, with a tough upper, it comes with lack of ventilation. I live in the desert, but a few humid trips to California had my shoes sopping wet. I've never had salt rings on my shoes before...\\r\\nLacing: The Flywire lacing system is a carry over from their road running shoes. This was the first shoe I've used with this system in place, and while it looks gimmicky, it allows a lot more fine-tuned tightening across the whole foot. I'm on my 4th pair of Wildhorses (with the most being 400 miles before retiring them to athleisure trips to the grocery store), and the Flywire cable system has broken once, as highlighted by another user in the reviews. Zappos replaced it for free. The Wildhorse also comes with an extra set of eyelets at the very top of the shoe, so if you're a heel-lock lacer, the option is there.\\r\\nI've included a couple photos to highlight the outsole flex tear that transpired after 350 miles, and also to show the condition of the Flywire lacing material starting to show the cabling peaking through. Not bad for 400 miles + 3 months of walking around.\\r\\n\", 'So far so good. Quite comfortable for daily use and very nice looking with jeans. For runs, they are fairly stiff as other reviewers have noted. They will probably need a break in. While some people seem to not like the overlay in the upper, for me it is working perfectly. I tried the Wildhorse 3 and was extremely disappointed at how my forefoot floated around laterally, resulting in blisters after about 5 miles. These seem a lot better. Nike road running shoes are truly a joke, and a disappointment for serious athletes (Adidas or Saucony far outperform). However, they managed to make a superb trail shoe based on this platform, which is similar to what they built the Terra Kigers on, but raised the drop and added a rock plate. They will probably screw this up next time they issue this shoe.\\r\\n', 'Felt great out of the box, I just preferred the other pair I ordered as to these. I still love Nike for street running and training shoes.\\r\\n', 'Good trail shoe. Offers adequate traction and I good support. Seems wide at the tread which did a great job of keeping me from rolling my foot and twisting an ankle. Does seem to fit tight and would recommend a half size up. ', 'Good solid shoe the kiger is a better option. Not a lot of cushioning.\\r\\n', 'Super narrow shoe. The look is great, but it was very uncomfortable.\\r\\n', 'great fit but it started falling apart within 1 week of wearing\\r\\n', 'Looked good in the picture but out of the box cheaply made! Already had a tear around where the tongue attaches to the shoe!

The Wildhorse also comes with an extra set of eyelets at the very top of the shoe, so if you're a heel-lock lacer, the option is there.\\r\\nI've included a couple photos to highlight the outsole flex tear that transpired after 350 miles, and also to show the condition of the Flywire lacing material starting to show the cabling peaking through. Not bad for 400 miles + 3 months of walking around.\\r\\n\", 'So far so good. Quite comfortable for daily use and very nice looking with jeans. For runs, they are fairly stiff as other reviewers have noted. They will probably need a break in. While some people seem to not like the overlay in the upper, for me it is working perfectly. I tried the Wildhorse 3 and was extremely disappointed at how my forefoot floated around laterally, resulting in blisters after about 5 miles. These seem a lot better. Nike road running shoes are truly a joke, and a disappointment for serious athletes (Adidas or Saucony far outperform). However, they managed to make a superb trail shoe based on this platform, which is similar to what they built the Terra Kigers on, but raised the drop and added a rock plate. They will probably screw this up next time they issue this shoe.\\r\\n', 'Felt great out of the box, I just preferred the other pair I ordered as to these. I still love Nike for street running and training shoes.\\r\\n', 'Good trail shoe. Offers adequate traction and I good support. Seems wide at the tread which did a great job of keeping me from rolling my foot and twisting an ankle. Does seem to fit tight and would recommend a half size up. ', 'Good solid shoe the kiger is a better option. Not a lot of cushioning.\\r\\n', 'Super narrow shoe. The look is great, but it was very uncomfortable.\\r\\n', 'great fit but it started falling apart within 1 week of wearing\\r\\n', 'Looked good in the picture but out of the box cheaply made!

      "Saucony Peregrine 7 \n",
      "{'shoe': 'Saucony Peregrine 7 ', 'gender': 'Male', 'reviews': [\"Why mess with perfection?? The Peregine 6 was my favorite trail runner of all time. The Peregrine 7 tried too hard to build on that and failed. In what appears to be an effort to make the lightest trail runner in it's class it made several compromises. First the good... The PWRTRAC outsole is scary good. It sticks like glue to any surface making you feel confident when traversing the most difficult trails. The EVERUN midsole provides above average cushioning for a shoe in its class. The shoe is super lightweight and breathable. One the negative side, the heal support in the Peregrine 7 is inferior to that in the Peregrine 6. The former sucked my heal into the shoe. Heal support in the Peregrine 7 is lacking and lateral stability compromised. In what I can only imagine is the desire to shave a few fractions or a gram off the weight the tongue is also shorter. This might seem like nitpicking but my feeling is it compromises comfort at the point where the laces are tied. If this is your first Peregrine purchase you may look right past these items, but if you're a Peregrine faithful these changes are noticeable.\", \"Best running shoes I've ever had. So far I've put over 80 miles on them and they have held up in both cushioning and support. Will buy again.\\r\\n\", 'I bought these for my hubby and he seems to really like them! He says they are lightweight and comfy. He has moderate arches with neutral pronation and these shoes are rugged enough to to trail runs as well as road walking/working out.\\r\\n', \"GREAT shoe but runs small. I am reordering half a size larger and hoping that's big enough. Plan to use it hiking in CO in about 2 weeks. Will update my review based on the other size and after hiking.\\r\\n\", 'While I liked the shoes, I’ve always been a Nike running shoe guy, in buying a trail shoe I’ve opted for a different brand I didn’t care for the toe box feel. These were comfortable and the sole had a great sturdiness I’m sure they would have held up great just not for me.\\r\\n', \"Came to this shoe from being an Altra fan. I love their wide toe box and zero drop. Sadly their midweight shoe(the Lonepeak) was just to wide for me to get the trail performance I need. Brook's were too narrow in the toes. These pleasantly surprised me! Enough room in toe box for my feet to spread but they side hill well and, have minimal rise in the heel. The tread chews up anything! I ran in steep muddy conditions not holding back and didn't slip!\\r\\nThe down sides are the tongue could be a little longer and the heel could lock you in better. If I tie the shoe perfectly it ok. Overall they have a fan!!\", \"Besides being incredibly light with super grip when trail running, the only minor issue is the lack of rubber around the front of the shoe. Running on rocky trails, you can stub your toe a bit. Otherwise, these shoes are really great, maybe I just have to pick up my feet a bit more! They fit like a glove with sport socks and the soles aren't too funny simply walking around, wearing these after a run to get a lunch or something.\", \"Gotta agree with the other reviewers: The heel box is too shallow (so your heel isn't snugly stable),the tongue is too short, and the shoe is about a 1/2 size too small.\\r\\nSadly, had to return them.\\r\\n\", 'I really wanted to like these shoes. I think they are worth a try if you’re interested. I ended up returning them because my heel kept slipping out the back. I’m not sure if it was the pair I got, or my foot shape with the shoe, but that ended up being a deal breaker for me given my intended purpose for the shoe (lots of sudden movements, actions). If it weren’t for that one thing, these would have been near perfect for me. Tread was great, style great, fit great.\\r\\n', \"I was excited to upgrade my Saucony Cohesion TR to this shoe. However, there is a stiff vertical seam on the inside right across the heel. They're ok for wearing around, but both trail runs I've tried resulted in blisters within minutes.\\r\\n\"], 'num_helpful': ['1', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['3', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '4', '3', '3', '2'], 'comfort': ['4', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '5', '4', '4', '1'], 'style': ['4', '5', '5', '5', '3', '5', '5', '2', '5', '4'], 'size': ['3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3'], 'width': ['3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3'], 'arch': ['3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3']}\n",

I don't plan to return the shoes (all the packaging has been tossed), but just wanted to let you know, and I will continue to shop with you as your customer service is the best.\", 'My son and I only wear Saucony athletic shoes for the following reason: only Saucony has an anatomically-friendly toe box. Their toe box is wider, and allows room for toes to grip & move. In addition to this one important feature, Saucony has consistently high quality and over-all great performance. The Omni Walker has a lot of cushioning & snug support. A good walking shoe for stability & comfort. I only wish this model came in more colors, or a sueded finish.\\r\\n', 'I am a nursing student and I got this shoe for clinical purposes. So far I have had nothing but comfort. This was a great choice and for those that are on their feet so many hours a day, this shoe is perfect for them.', \"Like heaven on your feet.\\r\\nMy father-in-law asked how could ZAPPOS deliver these shoes within 24 hours. I said they were delivered by an angel because they felt like heaven on my feet. These are without a doubt the most comfortable shoes I have ever walked in. Five mile walks leave my FEET feeling better than 2 miles in my New Bal's. Don't ever quit making the Saucony Grid Omni Walker.

It's hard to find a shoe the right length, but wide enough in the toes yet narrow in the heel. My official shoe size is women's 8.5 wide - but I usually buy men's athletic shoes for the width. I tried these shoes in men’s 7.5 D first, but sent them back for a 7.5 E. They couldn't fit better....roomy toes, snug enough heel.

I wear a 13, have narrow, genetically screwed up feet, and haven't felt comfortable standing since childhood.

I love the ease of putting in orthotics. I generally have a pair of runners and a pair of walkers. These have great support and very good comfort straight out of the box. I've tried half a dozen other brands, but none were so consistent for me - which means, easy to make a great choice on the website with far fewer returns. Love this shoe.\", 'White Saucony sneaker -\\r\\nI finally broke down and ordered a pair of these shoes.

The size 13 NB 844 fit well, but it did not seem to give me much cushioning. While I am used to my running shoes (Brooks Adrenaline) being flat, I am used to walking shoes giving me a bit of a roll as I walk, helping the natural gait. The NB 844 did not give me any sort of roll. That coupled with the lack of cushioning led me to not like them.\\r\\nI then tried on the Saucony, and it felt like a little slice of heaven. It was supportive and cushioned, and gave me the roll that I was looking for when I walked. Consumer Reports rated this as very highly, and I can see why.

I have narrow ankles and a semi-wide forefoot. These shoes fit like a glove with no heel slippage. I usually wear arch support orthotics but they were not needed with these shoes. I also buy my athletic shoes a half size larger to account for foot swelling. It was too large (long) and I went back down to my normal size which still offered plenty of space from the end of my toe to the shoe front. I hope Saucony keeps making these for a long, long time. I can see why Consumer Reports rated these the top rated walking shoe.\", 'Very Comfortable from the start. Unlike competitive brands, size marked is accurate. Will buy again.', 'Excellent comfort -\\r\\nI bought these for my husband, based on the favorable Consumer Report rating. He LOVES them! Wears them everywhere. All day. He has a problem with pronation, which this shoe addresses.\\r\\n', \"Comfortable and Supportive -\\r\\nThese may be the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. They're very well cushioned, yet not bouncy, and they provide solid support all around without digging into the bottom of my ankles as many sports shoes do. Except for the solid color, I find the shape and look of the shoe to be very good, although I prefer a little more contrast (e.g., silver and blue, navy and white). Also, the free one-day shipping was just that: approximately 24 hours after I ordered, the shoes arrived. Hard to believe.\", 'Love Zappos -\\r\\nThe title does sounds cornie I know but I ordered my shoes Friday the 23rd of December and they arrived The following Tuesday! I was, to say the least, amazed.\\r\\nI followed the advice of Consumer Report and bought these shoes because I stand a lot on concrete......everyday. The shoes fit great, just love them. The shoes are everything that the description said they were. They serve my feet well.\\r\\n', \"Not the best shoe I've worn -\\r\\nAfter reading all the positive reviews on these shoes, I decided to give them a try. They are very light and pretty comfortable. I didn't like the clickity clop sound they made when walking on hardwood or concrete floors. Soles seemed harder than New Balance and slippery when wet. I think I'll stick with New Balance and maybe give Asics a try.\\r\\n\", 'The Omni Walkers are very comfortable shoes I must say. I walk about 30 miles a week and having comfortable shoes is obviously a priority. However, because they are made of a soft leather they squeak with every step and it can be loud at times. This is the second pair that I have owned and I would not have bought the second pair had they not be so comfortable as I was hoping that the squeaking was just a fluke with my first pair, unfortunately the second pair squeaks just as bad. I will not purchase these again as for me the squeak out weighs the comfort. Also the look of them is pretty blah. Pretty plain, these could use a little more personality. However I will stick with the Saucony brand. I have purchased other styles of theirs with good luck.', \"I'm in my 70's, walk 4-5 miles daily as my main source of exercise and have short, wide feet.\\r\\nI ordered 3 pair of Walking Shoes, size 8 Wide: Saucony Grid Omni Walker, NB WW877-grey with baby\\r\\nblue trim and shoelaces (love the colors!) and Ryka Dash 2. At first, the Saucony Grid Omni Walker\\r\\nwere a bit stiff, but after wearing them a few times, they have softened and still maintain their support\\r\\nand comfort. They're very STURDY. This is the first time I've purchased athletic shoes on line.\\r\\nSo far, these Saucony pair and the NB Omni Walker are definite keepers. I've tried on the Ryka pair,\\r\\nand they look and feel fine, but I still have to take a few daily walks to make a final judgement.\\r\\nZappos wide selection, excellent return policy and especially the comprehensive reviews,\\r\\nwere extremely helpful in making my selections. This coming week I plan to test the Ryka Dash 2\\r\\nand write a review for that pair as well. \", \"Great shoes. I am a UPS driver and on my feet around 10hrs a day. Have had these shoes for a month and zero complaints so far. As comfortable of a shoe as I've ever had. No foot discomfort even when I work a 12hr day. Other reviews were right on about the size. Length is normal. Width is slightly narrow. And saw a few reviews about a squeak. I agree with that too. Not annoying but you notice it once in awhile.

So far, they are comfortable and are providing the hoped-for support on my long walks.Would have liked a wider range of colors.', 'I had to return the first pair of shoes I had ordered, and Zappos was wonderful! The pair I am wearing - in great comfort - right now arrived the next day! No hassle! No return charges! You bet that my wife and I are sold on your company! We thought \"customer service\" was a thing of the past.', 'Comfortable shoe -\\r\\nVery comfortable from day 1. A pleasure to walk in.\\r\\n', \"I went by the consumer report rating walking shoes. Purchased the NB 791 rated #1 & Saucony Grid Omni Walker rated #2. I walk on an average of 5 miles (3) times a week. I personally rate the Saucony Grids #1 as far a cushion & comfort, they gives extra support in the instep that NB 791 does not offer. After wearing the NB, my feet will cramp & hurt in the instep making it uncomfortable to walk. My feet have never hurt with the Saucony Grid Omni's.\", \"Very pleased -\\r\\nA very good shoe. Extremely fast delivery. Order a bit wider than normal if you're going to wear a thick sock.\\r\\n\", 'Sauconys Walkers -\\r\\nWithout doubt, the most comfortable athletic shoe on the market. While not advertised like Nike and Reebok, Saucony is better built for comfort whether running or walking.\\r\\n', 'First Class -\\r\\nExtremely comfortable.\\r\\n', 'Ultimate Comfort -\\r\\nI have chronic Achilles tendonitis and a partial tear of the tendon. I had surgery 3 months ago, but no matter what \"good\" running shoe I wore, the inflammation would come back. Then I got the Saucony Grid Omni Walker (after reading Consumer Report\\'s review). Now I am inflammation free. The shoes feel like a comfortable pair of slippers, but the support and flexibility is unmatched.\\r\\n', 'Good shoe -\\r\\nWidth and size felt true, but is a little uncomfortable in the heel area, is made with a hard material.\\r\\n', 'Saucony Walker -\\r\\nAbsolutely the most comfortable athletic shoe on the market today. Makes walking a pleasure.\\r\\n', \"This is a great fitting and feeling shoe; however, I do have an issue with it. After wearing it for only 2 weeks, and I only wear it to the gym, I found that the soles make a noise (like the whoooosh of air escaping) every time I take a step. This doesn't seem to affect the performance of the shoe or the fit but I find it very annoying to listen to.\", \"Without a doubt, these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned and I logged quite a few miles on my last pair. Also, these are one of the few walking shoes that look good in a professional office environment. But in less than a year the uppers had stretched to the point that both sides met in the middle where they lace up. As a result, the toe appeared crinkled and pinched in. After trying a couple of other brands, however, I bought another pair of Sauconys due to the comfort.\", \"Less padding than the Saucony running shoes I am used to. Comfortable for walking but the shoes squeak, on all surfaces. This has not gone away over time. Fit is good. Bland styling (all black or white) but that's what I need for a work shoe.\", 'This was a replacement/exchange for another brand of walking sneaker I purchased and I am glad it worked out this way. The shoe is true to size and conformed nicely after one 2.5 mile walk. I walk daily so any extra shock absorbing attributes are appreciated. The shoe has an almost lighter than air feel to them and yet are even more supportive to other. more expensive brands I have worn. I used to wear Saucony almost exclusively for walking and gravitated to other brands over the years, I am glad I have rediscovered the brand. I would recommend these shoes to a serious walker, I have a feeling they will hold up as well as any other, if not better.', \"Very good shoe, could be better -\\r\\nI have wide feet. My size 11 wide fits very well in the forefoot, but this shoe does have a quirky heel. It's narrower (inside) than most, and the insoles have a small but very sharp little wedge on the sides in lieu of a rounded heel cup. I find this causes some heel pain.\\r\\nI also tried putting my rather thick orthotics into the shoe; it is not really big enough to accommodate them, and the somewhat unusual, rounded shape of the heel cup throws my foot too far forward on the orthotic, so I can't really use the orthotics with these shoes. I expect others would also experience this.\\r\\nI tried removing the insoles and replacing them with flat ones; that works better.\\r\\nThe stability claimed for the shoe stems from its very wide heel. The bottom of the heel flares outward, making it at least an inch wider than the heel of your foot. This creates an odd sensation when walking, especially on uneven ground: your heel feels like it's hitting the ground a little early.\\r\\nCushioning is excellent, better than New Balance. Acceptable arch support (my arches are high, so I always need more than shoemakers provide).\\r\\nStyling, as other owners have pointed out, is a bit boring: all white, in my case.\\r\\nAll in all a very good shoe that could be better. \", 'SE Gawga -\\r\\nI previously posted that I felt like New Balance was more comfortable but after wearing these awhile, they really start to grow on you! They are very light and comfortable and they have become my favorite shoe to wear over NB MR858, Nike Air Monarch and Asics GT2130.\\r\\n', 'Fairly Comfortable, but no airflow makes the foot hot.\\r\\nThe shoe is fairly comfortable, but a bit hot after replacing a worn pair with comfortable mesh topside. I get anxious to take he shoe off at night. Airflow around the foot is limited; could Saucony have added a mesh feature to increase airflow and make your foot cooler?\\r\\nThe size 9.5 Wide seemed no wider than the 9.5 Medium, but the 10 Wide I tried on seemed much wider than everything; very confusing.\\r\\nThe shoe\\'s fairly handsome, with its black model as black and practical as it can be, but even a thin pinstripe detail on the white model would spruce it up and keep it from looking so stark white; the \"silver\" in the white/silver model virtually disappears as you look at the show in real life.', 'Fast delivery -\\r\\nShoe was delivered fast...sized ok...but the arch was a little too much for me. I sent the first pair back and reordered a wide. Much better still a little bothersome slightly on one foot but kept them anyway.\\r\\n', 'Comfort plus support -\\r\\nThis is the third pair of this Saucony model that I have had. The fit for my 10 1/2 and medium wide foot was perfect. The shoe is light, gives excellent support. I love to wear it and will shortly buy a black model, so I can pass it through for more formal occasions. My 4 stars instead of 5 is because the model is not quite as sturdily built in its latest appearance. It gains in lightness.', \"Would be perfect if it came in 4-E!\\r\\nI loved the way the cushioning in this shoe felt, & that it didn't have a lot of motion stability to it, but I wasn't able to wear it in the size 10, 2-E width. The forefoot felt good, & the heel cushioning was great, but the arch area was too hard!! My right foot is totally flat, so when I'd walk, my arch would ride on this horribly hard ridge where the leather connects to the sole of the shoe. It hurt!! At first I thought the shoes had a really good arch support in them, but I soon figured out it wasn't that, I was walking on the top part of the sole of the shoe! I even tried a half size & a full size up, but it still hurt. So I had to send them back & keep looking. I think if it came in a 4-E width it might have worked.\", 'Great Shoes -\\r\\nThis is a great shoe. Snug fit, good support. About a 1/2 size small. We had to order up.\\r\\n', 'Pros: Good shoe. Decent style. Comfortable toe box. Cons: Squeaks!', \"These shoes run a little wide in my opinion. My heels slip a little in them. Usually I find Saucony fits my narrow foot well. I also found the arch support in these a little too much and it bothers my foot after standing in them for a short while. I also find them to be not very good looking shoes. And they do make noise when you walk in them. I don't recommend.\", \"Initially I really liked these shoes. They fit well and were comfortable. I've now been wearing them less than 2 months and I'm not happy with how poorly they've held up. The soles feel shot and are literally falling apart. I've never seen anything like it. The rubber on the bottom of the right shoe is actually coming off bit by bit. I've never seen anything like it. I work on tiled and carpeted flooring so there's no explanation. I also typically get at least 12 months out of a pair of shoes. Maybe I got a lemon pair, but at this price I can't afford to try them again.\", 'It felt good right out of the box.

I didn't buy shoes for looks though, they need to carry 400+lbs around a track. I've put about 10 miles on them so far at the local track, seem to be holding up. Make sure you get them laced up tight though, it feels like my feet move a bit (front to back)... maybe I needed a 1/2 smaller size, but normally wear a 15 wide. Width felt good, no issues there.\", 'My adult son has big wide feet and is not a fan of the whole retail store shopping experience. Thus, we, his parents, have been referring to his only pair of work shoes as his \"sandals\" due to the fact that the soles are barely hanging on to the tops. I am surprised that his supervisor has not complained about his disreputable footwear. He works in a medical facility and it seems to me these old shoes could be considered a health hazard. After a great deal of nagging on my part, he and I chose a variety of sizes and widths of shoes from Zappos. The shoes arrived the next day. Out of five pairs, these Sauconys were the only ones that fit, so he\\'s keeping them. He likes the support he gets around the ankle and though they are not a dressy looking shoe, they are miles better than the shoes they have replaced. The other pair we found that also fit him are the Rockport Prowalker M 7100, size 13 EEEE. 13 wide was not wide enough in this shoe. The Merrell Moab Ventilator was not wide enough for him in either size 13 W or size 14 W and the 14s were too long for his foot. So if your size 13 feet are seriously wide, these Sauconys may work for you.

Found my favorite brand in casual/athletic shoe Saucony, placed the order online and shoes were shipped immediately and no shipping/handling charges! I love ZAPPOS!\", 'Had a pair before, and they were excellent in all ways. They are very comfortable, quite weatherproof, stable, and they last about 100 miles, before the cap of the heel wears to the foundation. I will order a pair every 4 months.', 'I wanted to commend the customer services department for the outstanding assistance this morning. It was prompt, friendly and extremely helpful.

I am a hard to fit 14EE having experienced that most shoe manufactures don't know what wide means or true length means. But these shoes exceeded my expectations for fit, comfort, durability,and performance. These have very stable soles with no side roll. Unlike other shoes that I own, I DO NOT use an aftermarket foot bed insert. Not necessary for comfort or support with hiking sox. To me they perform like I would expect a low cut hiking shoes to perform. These are actually better than many light hikers I have owned. And they are not clunky when I wear a pair for casual dress. The uppers have held up well from hiking. This surprised me given the nice soft leather uppers. Sole wear has been good too.\", 'Excellent accurate fit and walking comfort from the first hour!

These Saucony shoes are comfortable. I've only had them a short time, so the verdict is not in yet on durability but they seem to be well made.\", 'The shoes were a gift for my husband. He loves them. Says they are very comfortable and have excellent tread.', \"This is my 4th pair of Sauconys and they are the best I've found at any price. Great for work, the gym or casual wear.\", 'Great shoes, perfect fit and comfortable from the start. As usual, Zappos was incredible. Ordered three pairs so I could try them on my treadmill, choose the pair I liked, and returned the others. Return was no hassle, and absolutely free. Zappos rocks!', 'Good buy, free shipping, great warranty. What else to say? Shoes were perfect for me. Received them quickly. I recommend Zappos and will buy there again.', 'Very comfortable and lightweight. I have worn these shoes for several months & I love them.', \"I walk briskly for exercise six days a week and, over the years, I've had many different brands of walking shoes from brands like a Asics, New Balance and Nike. These shoes are the most comfortable, supportive and shock absorptive shoes I have ever owned. They fit like a glove and, while I have not worn them in summer temperatures, seem to do well at moisture management. Highly recommended!\", \"I had gotten tired of my standby NB cross-trainers wearing out so quickly. So I tried these. So far they are great. Obviously they have not had time to war out, but at this point the fit and comfort are great. My only complaint is I really like all black shoes so I can wear anywhere from gym to my daughter's wedding; these have a white design feature at the back that would let anyone know I have no class.\", 'Excellent shoe but one heel separated at the edge. Zappos sent a new pair quickly. Great service.', 'Shows would have been great except it rubbed the ankle bone on both feet!', \"Bought these Saucony walkers for my son. They are great, very comfortable for longs hours and fit him nicely. True to size and as advertised and Zappos' fast delivery was perfect as always.\", 'Bought these for a vacation to Switzerland. Had very little time to break them in, then spent 15 days walking in cities and mountains throughout Switzerland and found the shoes to be extremely comfortable and stable. Highly recommend!', 'My bad. Would have been great shoes except there is no doubt I need an eeee or wider shoe. Zappos was spectacularly awesome in shipping the shoes to me in time for my trip!', 'The walkers are excellent for anyone who has problems with their feet. I wear them for business especially walking through so many airports. Great shoe!', \"I've owned several pairs of these Sauconys. They're comfortable, easy walking and do a great job softening the pounding of pods on pavement. Traction is good and they wear like crazy. I'll keep buying them as long as Saucony pays attention to what works.\", 'My husband has a medical condition that makes him very unsteady on his feet, which makes him fall often. The Saucony Gird Omni Walker is very light and easy for him to put on and was comfortable walking right from the beginning.', \"My first Saucony shoe. Feels very nice, very comfortable. I like the design of the shoe. Simple. I would've liked a 4E width shoe though. But still feels nice with my feet. Construction feels solid. Less heavy than other walking shoes. The thinner lining in the front dissipates heat better than heavier leather. \", \"I bought these sneakers for my husband. He LOVES them. He says he feet feel really good ALL day. He's an auto mechanic so he's on his feet ALL day! \", \"I'm 60 and I walk 8 miles every day to and from work. Mainly for exercise and to avoid the NY Subway. I've been through many different walking shoes in the past, most recently New Balance. I find that lately the quality of their shoes is very hit or miss. I decided to try these after reading a review where someone in my age range said he walked a lot and found them comfortable for long stretches.\\r\\nThey are the best walking shoes I've ever had. The comfort level is very high especially in the heel where I was beginning to develop plantar fasciitis.\\r\\nThey have excellent support under the metatarsals too. With New Balance I felt I was walking in sandals. The Saucony's have a full thick sole that cushions and protects. I took out the stock insoles and replaced them with Spenco Arch Cushion supports which I have in all my shoes. They just give some extra added comfort on long walks.\\r\\nI really enjoy my daily hike much more now and I would recommend these shoes to anyone who walks as much or more than I do!\\r\\nI ordered the widest width available and found them a bit snug on the first few wears but they've settled very nicely with no adverse effects.\\r\\nI'll be ordering more soon because when I like something this much, invariably it is discontinued soon after!\\r\\n\", 'Very comfortable, very supportive. I will continue to get these shoes. I feel like my stride is more natural, smooth, and easy with these. I used to walk in running shoes which are a little higher in the heel. Maybe that is the difference. But I highly recommend these shoes.', 'On my sixth pair of these, I do a lot of walking on my job and try to walk for 30 minutes every day and these walkers always perform well all day and night long. From the moment I put on a new pair until they hit 100,000 miles. Also, it seems like they got the shoestring length right finally; they used to be a little long. Also, I can always depend on Zappos to get me a new pair in 2 days!', \"I usually wear trail running shoes for my daily dog walk since they are so light and comfortable. However, I decided to try these based on reviews and the fact that the trail runners get wet easily here in the NW. These are so much more comfortable and supportive than my previous shoes, it's quite shocking. Only downside is mentioned by others, not very breathable. Feet can get hot and sweaty, probably not a good option for summer weather.\", \"I'm a 63-year-old who walks a vigorous 2 miles daily. I had been wearing some super-duper Nike shoes, but my knees were getting worse and worse (though I didn't make the connection). When the Nikes wore out, I decided to try these Sauconys, though I was not familiar with the brand. The material and workmanship are both outstanding. But the best part is that the soft soles almost completely eliminated my knee pain in only the first week. I've had them for a couple months now and just love them! My next pair will be these again, if they're still available when my new ones wear out. Thanks, Saucony!\", 'I have worn these shoes for approximately five years, and they are the only tennis shoes that I can wear. I have narrow feet, plantar fasciitis, as well as Achilles tendinitis on one foot. I wear additional inserts in these shoes, and they work well for me and have for many, many years.', \"Ive been walking 30 miles a week in these shoes for 3 months,, the shoes are super comfortable and very well built,, I'm picky but I would highly recommend these shoes for walking.. they are holding up real well, with a lot of mileage on them.\"], 'num_helpful': [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5'], 'comfort': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '2', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5'], 'style': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5'], 'size': ['3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3'], 'width': ['3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3'], 'arch': ['3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3']}\n",

      "{'shoe': 'Saucony Grid® Omni Walker ', 'gender': 'Male', 'reviews': ['These are excellent shoes for work. The soles are thick and absorb the pressure of the concrete floors. I know good shoes. After having back surgery nine years ago, I am able to stand on my feet for hours and work in a retail store. Thanks, Saucony, for making good shoes with high arches!', 'I am a senior and walk at least 2 miles per day and these shoes are very kind to my feet and legs. Lots of good, firm support. This is my 3rd pair!', 'I bought this for my husband who has flat & wide feet but is very active physically. He loves these shoes! They provide good arch support and also have enough space to fit in his orthotics. Very happy with the buy.', 'These are very comfortable! They feel like sneakers, but look like shoes. There is plenty of sole cushioning. I am a UPS driver; so I give shoes a beating. I have worn them for approximately two weeks now. The provide no ankle support, but that is expected as these are walking shoes.', 'Great shoes. The soles are very sturdy. I have walked all day in these shoes and my feet do not hurt like they normally do in other shoes. The only negative there might be is they can make your feet a bit warm.', 'Excellent shoes and excellent shipping time! I got the shoes only a few days after ordering and they fit and feel great.\\r\\n', 'I bought these for my husband who has diabetes and broke his ankle a few years back, so his feet give him trouble...he loves these shoes. Says they are comfortable without the old man look, and his feet and legs feel better. I am going to get him another pair, he was so happy with these.', 'I took a chance and ordered this shoe for my husband.\\r\\nHe put the shoe on, and I do believe he has worn it ever since! Well, I think he has taken them off to sleep!\\r\\nHe has a flat, narrow foot that pronates. In other words, he is difficult to fit.\\r\\nHe absolutely loves this shoe. He walks our dogs every day, except Sunday, an hour a day. He says the shoe is pure comfort!\\r\\nThis shoe is perfect for him and I plan to order another pair to change out so they will last longer. ', 'This is as basic as a tennis shoe you can buy, the fit was a bit snug and the shoe squeaked right out the damn box. ', 'Very comfy! (My DW thinks they look like \"old man\" shoes)', \"I had never worn a Saucony before. I tried the Grid Omni Walker because the selection of walking shoes is very limited. I am very pleased with them. They seemed a little small at first, but a couple of walks and they felt great. They fit snugly enough without being too tight and therefore don't slip either. They have excellent arch support which is important for walking. I will definitely buy these again.\", \"I wear these with my scrubs at work. They aren't amazing to look at, but they are so comfy. Arch support is great!\", 'The Saucony Grid Omni Walkers are lightweight, which for me is good. I am 55 and have auto-immune and joint pain, and chronic fatigue/pain, so I can\\'t handle heavy shoes. The Saucony Grid Omni Walkers fit the widest part of my foot , across the bottom of the toe bones, which is 4 and 1/8-inches across the left and more like 4 and 1/16th inches across the right--at the widest part of my foot. My feet are exact 10-inches in length. I have relatively high arches. I have a \"neutral\" gait, i.e. my shoes wear out evenly. I bought a size 8.5 EE. My heels did not slide around because the shoe isn\\'t made like a long oblong-rectangle. In other words, the toe box is roomier, and the heel a little bit more narrow but not too narrow. The shoes fit right out of the box, no breaking in, no struggle. I tried them on with a pair of not too thin, nor too thick jog socks with a higher ankle so the socks wouldn\\'t slip down. Not only did these fit like my old sneakers (a model not made any longer), but there was not a hint of \"rubbing\" anywhere: top of my foot, top of my toes, anywhere around the heel, and not at the widest part just under the toes where some other sneakers have been too snug. These sneakers fit like I already had been wearing them, in a good way. Even lacing them up felt familiar, easy to tighten, strong shoelaces, and a tongue that can be moved around unlike some brands/models that have \"attached tongues\" to keep out dirt, but no \"wiggle in or out room.\" After putting them on and lacing them securely, I walked over and got on my manual treadmill which is why I bought these Saucony Grid Omni Walkers--for the manual treadmill, and only for that purpose. The tread is sturdy enough, no sliding on the treadmill wheel, which I had a problem with when I tried the New Balance 574s, which have a plastic bottom/tread: Cheap and slippery. These Saucony Omni Grid Walkers, the ones I bought, are white. I\\'m not into the fancy or day-glow kinds of colors. They are not impressive looking, and will not be noticeable with anything you wear if you take them on the road. I would wear them outside if I weren\\'t saving them to be used exclusively with my manual treadmill. As for quality, no one seems to make shoes as well as they once did, which isn\\'t Zappos\\' fault. They are OK in construction but if you are going to walk a lot in there and have any kind of foot pain, I\\'d suggest replacing the factory insert with something spongier. I get pain in the ball of my foot that shoots into the big toe area so if I were going to wear these on terrain that is uneven, or were going to wear them for hours a day, I\\'d buy inserts. The Zappos members I worked with were friendly, patient, likable, helpful: They sent out each pair to me to try as needed, never even a hint of \"Wow, you\\'re a pain in my bee-hind\" as some customer service persons can sound from other companies. I\\'m friendly, too, so that helps, but it doesn\\'t account for the time they took to help me through picking out shoes when one pair I wanted to try was out of stock or didn\\'t come in a wide or extra wide. So, again, to wrap it up: I\\'m a woman with \"duck feet.\" I was hard to keep in shoes as a baby. My Mom said she couldn\\'t shove them in baby shoes so I went barefoot a lot; lord knows what I wore in the winter--I suppose thick socks and a blanket, hurried into a car. My left foot is 10 and 1/8 inches long and one to two lines over the 4-inch mark at the widest part just below the toes: My left is slightly wider than my right. I never wear one size every time with all models of shoes, and I always have to wear men\\'s shoes; them\\'s the breaks. If you want a pair of sturdy, comfortable, plain looking shoes that you can wear on you treadmill, or out and about with another cushion (if you have foot pain), go for these; just go by my measurements, give them to a team member if need be--after standing on copy paper (two taped together if your feet are longer than my own) and tracing them carefully, and measuring them at least twice to be sure you got it right: I used a bright green roller ball pen to make it easy to read. The only reason for four instead of five stars is I don\\'t think, for the price I paid, these are quite worth that, but I live on a very tight budget, and the last pair of sneakers I bought (six years ago; I am that kind of broke) were a lot less. Nothing is made as well any more, and that\\'s not Zappos\\' fault; that\\'s just the way it goes, any more.', 'These remind me of the Reeboks I used to wear and loved. Leather outside with good heel and ankle support. The shoes feels a little snug, and the arch support is very high. This is definitely narrower than the Jazz originals, I am able to wear the medium width of the same size and still felt comfortable. I normally wear EE or half a size larger, and they felt tight. I think these shoes will feel better after it breaks in. My only issue is the back of the heel is a bit flimsy and it bends in whenever I slide my feet in, this will probably stay bent after more usage. I like to have my shoes laces pre-tied so I can slide in my feet.', \"This is the squeakiest darn shoe I've ever had. New: they squeaked; 200+ miles of walking: still squeaking. You can't sneak up on anyone in these babies!\", \"Shoes are comfortable. They really do squeak. I thought people were exaggerating but it is true. I'm not super impressed by these shoes though. Could have paid less and got the same quality IMO. Also, I regret not getting shoes that are slip proof and waterproof. I walk a lot in them and my feet never hurt so that is a plus.\", 'Nice shoe. Nice style. Fits nice, the right does squeak alittle. Still like they feel.', 'This is my third pair in four years. Unlike the earlier pairs, which fit like a glove on day one, this version lacked arch support, the fit was a bit large, and they were rather stiff at first. I bought an orthopedic insert and a heel spacer, which cured the problem, and with a few days use they again are very comfortable. I do not know if my experience is typical, but I think Saucony should review the current design.', 'I an very hard on shoes. They last 3 to 6 months and they are worn out. I supinate as well. It is very hard to get a good shoe that I can walk in. I think these are decent shoe. First I bought the wide width and I was miserable. I had to send them back. So I got the 9 regular. After wearing these for several days I a have blister on my right pinky toe and another blister on the side of my right heel. So these shoes are tight. Maybe they will break in and my feet will heal and they will be okay.', 'Good support. Quality material. Roomy toe box. Runs just a titch tight. Good shoe for all-day walking/standing.', \"I have a history of shin splits from running when I was younger, plus flat feet. Finding good walking shoes has always been a challenge. So far, I'm happy with the Sauconys. Toebox was initially a wee bit tight, but after two walks, it stretched to fit my foot well.\", 'I have to walk on flat concrete at a big box store everyday for my job. I wanted something with excellent arch support, and did not find these to have enough. Heel cushioning was good, though.', 'These might have been comfortable, but they fit on the narrow side - toes were forced together.', \"This is the 3rd pair of these shoes I have bought, and the first pair that squeaked. I've tried WD-40, I've tried a light coat of grease, and the squeak persists. As much as I like these shoes, it can be embarrassing at times. So I don't know if I will buy another pair or not.\", 'Nice shoe for flat feet and putting in orthotics for long distance walking. Only drawback is the plastic sections under the heel areas start \"squeaking\" loud once you go from land or pavement to flat tile floors like in shopping malls, then they can hear you coming from a mile away! Not sure what causes this either; must be some trapped air in the heel plastic area? Only on happens on tile or flat floor areas...keep for outdoors and they are fine!'], 'num_helpful': [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4'], 'comfort': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '5', '4', '5', '3', '4', '4', '5', '3', '5', '5'], 'style': ['5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '3', '4', '2', '4', '5', '4', '4', '5', '5', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '4', '5'], 'size': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '4', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3'], 'width': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '4', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3'], 'arch': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '4', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3']}\n",

I've had several pairs over the years, with the last pair bought in Aug 2015, and they all squeak. And I'm not talking tiny squeaks. They are loud, really loud. I thought it was just me. I rated these 5 stars in the past but now that I know the squeaking is problematic with this particular shoe I can only rate it 3 stars.\", \"These shoes have extra support on the heel.

While others have said this shoe runs true to size, it surely does not. It feels at least one half size too small and the EE wide is narrower than other D widths. I never returned shoes to Zappos but lately everything I get has an issue, quality, looks or sizing, it's frustrating, not a good experience anymore.\", \"The shoes have been all and all ok. I couple things that they could improve. When they get damp, they squeak - like the sound you hear in cartoons when people have squeaky shoes - but this is your life not a cartoon.

I can't believe that Saucony hasn't notice this or they were just flat out defective. I would have given this shoe no stars for comfort if I could. I'm looking for a Black walking shoe for work because I'm on my feet all day on hard floors. I may try the Brooks Addiction or a New Balance shoe at this point. No Saucony for me!\", 'The shoe is okay, but the inside stitching requires the use of adhesive padding to prevent friction ulcers.', 'I switched from the Spira Classic Walker to the Saucony Grid Omni Walker and it was a mistake. The Saucony are stiff in the soles, lacking a comfortable bend when walking. They also lack sufficient padding or thickness in the soles. The fit is a bit tight, not true to size. Comfort takes priority over style and the Saucony failed with this shoe. They look similar to the Spira but fall way short in comfort. I will go back to wearing Spira Classics.', \"The fit and size were right on, quite comfortable. My wife tells me they look like old man's shoes. The big problem is they squeak when walking. Started on the third day. If it wasn't for the squeak I would give these a higher rating.\\r\\n\", 'Tried these for 3 months and I\\'m finally pulling the plug. Wore them to the gym and occasionally just out and about. I thought they would stretch a bit but they never did. Toebox is too narrow and too shallow (not tall enough). If you have a \"tall\" foot, this may be a problem for you. Width is marginal. I have had wide shoes from other brands that felt truly wide. These really don’t. The leather over the toebox developed wrinkles in a short amount of time. The shoes started getting a noticeable squeak, too. Saucony, I wanted to like you, but it\\'s you, not me.\\r\\n', 'I have these less than a year and the sole is already coming off.\\r\\n', \"1st time buyer, very unhappy with this shoe. For some reason hurts the top of my left foot's big toe. very rigid, very uncomfortable. the heel feels like its elevated on the instep of the heel, uneven. I was a first time buyer from this company, and will not purchase this brand again. \", \"I had great expectations going in for this shoe. As another reviewer also commented. This shoe started squeaking about 4 hours after wearing it. I am using the shoes in dry office conditions. The squeak is very noticeable. At the end of the first day the in step of the right shoe started to bulge in and hurt my foot. After the first week , these shoes hurt my feet to the point I can't wear them. It is too late to return, so I will have to eat the cost. Zappos should at least let us return the shoes so they can give them away to people in need. This is the first pair of Saucony I have had a problem with.\", 'After a year, the side of the shoe separated from the sole, making the shoe unusable. Poor quality adhesive holding sole onto upper.', 'I have a very high arch and like support for it. These shoes have very good side supports for the heel, but I would like it to extend just a bit more for the arch. These have better support and comfort compared to many other walking shoes I have tried, so I kept them. Long term, they felt better and shaped to my foot better. I ordered the EE for my wide feet and the front box area give adequate room for my toes. Compared to Nike and New Balance, the EE is very wide. Unfortunately, after only a few weeks of use, they started to develop a \"crunch\" like noise internally (not the sole, but rather internal). The noise is getting louder and is now in both shoes. I believe something internally is losing is lamination. They still feel fine and give good support but are too embarrassing to wear due to the noise. While comfortable, I do not recommend these shoes due to problems with longevity and a limited warrantee (45 days).'], 'num_helpful': [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2'], 'comfort': ['3', '3', '5', '2', '3', '3', '3', '2', '5', '5', '4', '3', '2', '5', '4', '1', '2', '3', '5', '1', '5', '1', '1', '4', '4'], 'style': ['3', '1', '5', '1', '2', '4', '3', '5', '5', '5', '3', '4', '3', '5', '4', '5', '4', '4', '3', '2', '5', '3', '2', '3', '3'], 'size': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '1', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '1', '3', '2', '3', '1', '3', '3', '4'], 'width': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '1', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '1', '3', '2', '3', '1', '3', '3', '4'], 'arch': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '1', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '2', '3', '3', '1', '3', '2', '3', '1', '3', '3', '4']}\n",

      "ASICS GEL-Kayano® 24 \n",
      "{'shoe': 'ASICS GEL-Kayano® 24 ', 'gender': 'Male', 'reviews': [\"1) I'm about a 200 lb guy (even though this review might show it is under my wife's amazon account) so cushion in a shoe is very important. I do 3 to 5 mile runs 4-5 nights a week.\\r\\n2) I try not to spend more than $100 on running shoes.\\r\\nA while back, I bought the Kayano 22 on clearance for about $100. I LOVE them. The cushioning was perfect for a heavier runner like me. I liked them so much that when it was time to replace them, I paid the full price for the Kayano 24. I wasted $150. They clearly changed directions and focused on weight instead of cushion. This model feels like running on cardboard. I'm not going for hyperbole here - there literally is no cushion in these. I run at night on the treadmill. During my first run they felt hard but I just hoped they needed to be broken in. The morning after my first run, my feet hurt. It got worse after my next two 5 mile runs. Finally tonight, a quarter mile into my run my feet were hurting so bad I had to stop, throw them in the closet and put my old model 22's on. I will say, when I put my model 22 on, I could definitely tell they are heavier than the model 24, but my god, the model 24 simply has no cushioning whatsoever. I can't figure for the life of me what you are paying $150 for with these. If you want lightweight shoes that hurt your feet, go for these. If you are looking for a comfortable shoe, I'd look somewhere else.\\r\\n\", \"Hallelujah I have finally found the perfect shoe for me! I am quite a bit of a flat-footed overpronator, which makes finding a shoe that won't give me blisters on my arches or toes like a quest for the holy grail. My main problems center around finding the right arch support and toe box width. I normally have to go to specialty running shops to find something that works for me.\\r\\nAfter reading reviews stating that ASICS had fixed the toe box sizing issue, I decided to give this one a try. This a very comfortable and lightweight shoe. I haven't run very long distances with it yet, but I did wear them on a variety of 5k runs and hikes without any issues. I really like the color scheme as well. Finally a shoe for men that's not plain gray, black, or white!\\r\\nI will most likely buy a second pair before they decide to change the model again.\\r\\n\", 'Asics finally fixed the toe box width and now they fit again.\\r\\n', \"I used to have Kayano 17.\\r\\nThis model is completely different and has no gel, I could see anyway.\\r\\nI gave 3 stars, as other shoes may be worse.\\r\\nHowever, if I were to compare with my old Kayano - I'd give this Kayano only one star.\\r\\n\", 'These fit perfectly from the moment I purchased them. Excellent support and the comfort is over the top!\\r\\n', 'My husband loves these. He says they are very comfortable even after a long day and they look great.\\r\\n', 'Great shoe for my teen son who has hyper-mobile ankles. Combined with his professionally made orthotics, he no longer has knee and foot pain.\\r\\n', 'Second try with this release. First on was half size too big so I reordered half size smaller than usual and they are back to the normal fit of a kayano.\\r\\n', 'excellant fit and comfort. I bought a second pair and would again\\r\\n', \"Literally fits like a glove. Very lightweight, the best fitting ASICS shoe ever, and this brand has been on my feet approximately 30 years. It's even better of course to replace the paper insole with a high performance orthotic. The aesthetic is great too, which matters because except for loafing around the house, I'll wear a shoe like this every day, so I need something that's going to look business like. Thank you to all the design staff at ASICS.\\r\\n\", \"I purchased these to replace a pair of Asics Gel Kinsei 6 shoes that I wore for about six months. I've been struggling with some pain in my Achilles and regardless of the various therapies I've tried, nothing was helping. Decided to replace the show with something that encouraged a slightly different foot fall. That did the trick. I've been wearing the Kayano's for about three weeks and my Achilles pain has nearly vanished and has not inhibited my running once since changing shoes. For reference, I run about 70 miles per month. I do not consider myself a runner. Over my life I've found that shoes, music, podcasts, books, location, etc. do nothing to get me in the zone that people who love to run find themselves in. Hope this helps.\\r\\n\", \"I LOVE this sneaker, and I love Asics. This was the first Kayano I ever bought, so I don't know about the previous versions. However, this sneaker runs really big and a bit wide. I have seen other reviewers mention that Asics changed the toe box, making it wider (which is actually great). However, I feel it is a bit too wide and the material they used really, really stretches. I am very hard to fit because of numerous foot issues and surgeries. I purchased these in a size 11--too big. That is my normal size, although I used to be an 11.5 (depending on the brand). Then I purchased a 10. 5 , and while I think this might be perfect, it still feels a bit too wide; I only buy medium width shoes, not wide styles. The mesh Asics uses for this shoe does in fact stretch out. I don't know if this stretches half a size or a full size, but the sizing is very strange for this particular Asics model. I think the support is great and I love how lightweight it feels, but unlike some reviewers, the sizing really seems off.\\r\\n\", 'I have wide very flat feet and I have worn custom orthotics for years. In the past I purchased New Balance 8.5 4E shoes and then they started getting narrower so a couple of years ago I tried the Brooks Beast and needed to go up in size to 9 / 4E and had great results. Then I needed some new shoes and I read recent reviews about the Brooks Beast being narrower so I thought I would try out several options and here are the results for me.\\r\\nAsics Gel Kayano 24 ordered 8.5 and 9 in 4E and both were too narrow – could barely get my foot in the shoe\\r\\nNew Balance M1540V2 ordered 8.5 in 4E and 6E (had to order 6E direct from NB). Both were too narrow. The 6E was close but not quite wide enough.\\r\\nBrooks Beast ’16 size 9 / 4E. The widest of the group and I am actually using them without the orthotics and they are feeling good.\\r\\n', 'The 24 4E is a 1/2\" smaller than the 23 4E at it\\'s widest point in the toe box.\\r\\nthat wasnt very good for me since i need the wide toe box to help prevent a Morton\\'s neuroma from forming.\\r\\nhopefully getting a larger size will solve the problem, otherwise, im going to need to find another shoe.\\r\\n', 'The shoes were fine. The cost was about 20% higher than if I had purchased them locally due to the shipping cost. Live and learn.\\r\\n', 'We’re too big. Strange because the last pair were a perfect fit.\\r\\n', 'I was hoping all the claims were not true, but it is, Asics changed something and i now have a very painful pair of over priced pieces of junk i cant return. I read alot of reviews but was hopeful when these showed up at my door that i had a decent pair, and they felt great in the house when trying them on. But when i stepped outside and went for a walk to really get the feel and then for a run today, I had to come home and take off the shoes because my feet hurt too much, way to narrow. I have worn and bought Asics, at least two pairs a year for the lat 5 years and i can no longer support this company. Something changed, the shoes got more narrow, and when buying an EE (if you can find them)runs too wide. $150 down the drain!\\r\\n', 'you\\r\\n?????\\r\\n????? 1 out of 5 stars. · a few seconds ago\\r\\nLost cushion\\r\\nI faithfully buy new Kayanos every Jan. Weathered the changes through the years, but one constant was their oh so good cushion. I have on-off plantar fasciitis and these have been a lifesaver. The toe on the 24s are wider, but WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE CUSHION? I even put my one year old 23s one one foot & new 24 on the other and my 1 yr old 23s STILL had so much more foot cushion! Wore my new 24s to boot camp this am - now my feet hurt.....such a BUMMER! What next, these will not work for me.....grrr\\r\\n', 'This was my 5th pair of Ascs Gel. Each was the very top end of the line!! However this pair is being returned because the wonderful Gel feeling is gone.

I will be a return customer because of the reasons mentioned!', \"I recently started walking in the morning for exercise, and purchased the Asics GEL-Tech Walker. It felt comfortable right out of the box! I wore them the very next morning. The best test result of a new shoe is not even thinking about it while you're wearing it. These shoes passed with flying colors.\", 'Excellent shoe for its purpose. I wore these for a vacation to NYC. According to my Garmin, I walked 47 miles in 8 days and the shoes felt great. I did not have one blister or sore feet at all. I did wear some dry-fit socks, which I know helped. The shoes felt a little awkward on my arch, but my feet felt great.', 'This is my third pair and I have them to be very comfortable. I use them for my walking. I also wear them for every day use during the summer.', \"Most comfortable, light, cool walking sneaker I've ever worn! Light like a running shoe, not ugly but with a walking shoe design. Highly recommended! \", \"I really needed good walking shoes, with shock absorption, good structure, and toe room. Attractive counted, too. I was drawn to the rich variety of choices available online, but had been put off by the hassle of returning stuff. Enter Zappos: I looked up the durable, attractive, high quality brand I keep coming back to: Asics. There's the shoe. Speedy delivery, recyclable packaging, perfect fit, and no pain. Problem solved! I ordered a second pair in white.\", 'The sneakers were the correct size and are very comfortable. I am very pleased and satisfied with the purchase.', \"These are great shoes! Comfortable and proper fit right out of the box and they've been worn every day since purchased for long-ish purposeful walks. Perfect. I would not hesitate to recommend or to buy again!\", 'Great shoe for walking or just wearing around. Good support, light weight, open toe box and nicely cushioned. I am a 40 year runner who can no longer run. Reduced to walking so no need to buy a high tech running shoe. This is perfect although the colors are bland. Highly recommend.', 'I recently ordered a pair of walking shoes that were delivered in one day, free shipping. After trying them on I found I found them to be too large. I sent them back using their paid for shipping label and the resent me (within 2 days) a new pair a size lower. Their phone receptionist was polite and led me thru the process. I have been with Zappos over 5 years and tell all I can of how satisfied we are with them.', 'These shoes came exactly as ordered and in an incredibly short time. I have worn them for two weeks and they look and feel better than I had hoped for.', 'These are great walking shoes. They run true to size and width. They are comfortable. I am walking about 5 - 7 miles a day. These shoes do the job!', \"My husband already knew he liked this particular shoe since he'd had it once or twice before. We're especially impressed that Zappos had it in his size and at a very reasonable price since we had checked several other websites first and no one had it in his size. The free shipping and timely delivery are also huge pluses in my book!\", 'I try to walk every day. However pain in my hip and knee prevents me from enjoying it very much anymore. I purchased these shoes and have walked in them for two days (A little over 3 miles each day). The pain in my knee and hip is a third of what it has been and I almost feel reborn and feel good about walking again.', \"I bought these shoes and I must say that they are very comfortable and well made shoes. Engineered for the walkers specifically! You will love 'em!\", 'As a treadmill desk walker, I put 7-10 miles on these shoes every day. So far this is the most durable shoe I have tried. I feel supported for almost two months before I replace them. This is almost double a few other brands that I have tried.', 'Excellent walking shoes. I like them because they are very comfortable but don\\'t look like they belong on someone over 65 - like many other \"walking shoes\" do (i.e. NB). I go 6-8 miles a day in these and my feet are dry/comfortable at the end of the walk. Well ventilated, only catch is that when its under 40 F, they can be a little cold.', 'Was pleasantly surprised by a inter net buy of shoes. Everything fit well, like them very much. shipped and received in a short time. Everything went smooth. Would buy from them again.', 'Ordered one pair and loved them, so immediately ordered another pair. Zappos.com shipped them right out, free, and I got them the next day. Completely happy with ASICS and Zappos.', \"I have a size 13 AAA foot and I'm picky. I don't want a shoe that looks like Unicorn puke nor do I want a shoe that looks like something my Grandpa would wear (I'm looking at you Velcro shoes). So, I struggle finding shoes that fit. Currently I'm wearing the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 so I'm getting used to the Neo Waker which has actual support.\\r\\nThe fit is good on this shoe so far. You can cinch it up pretty tight without crumpling the toe box. If you have extremely narrow feet you'll know the struggle. The laces will need to be trimmed so they don't hit the ground but I'm used to that. The mid section of this shoe is pretty narrow which is good for me. For you 'normies' you might find it too narrow. For those of use with feet the size of cross country skis it's welcoming. It provides comfortable support. As a walking shoe the toe box is quite ample and should provide plenty of room for those 12 hour walking sessions around Disney World.\\r\\nThere seems to be plenty of support all around in this shoe which is nice. I can feel it supporting the back side of my foot below the ankle something I've never had in a shoe before.\\r\\nSize wise it feels a little big but from researching online you want at least a thumb width from your longest toe to the end of the shoe. This shoe provides that and a smidgen more. This is where the 12.5 would probably have been a better choice but it was out of stock.\\r\\n\", 'This shoe is amazing. I work at an airport and walk back and forth throughout the terminals all day and my feet feel fine when I get home. I am very satisfied with this product.', 'I wear a 14-M, but these shoes run small (they were actually difficult to put on). I\\'m usually a NB devotee (primarily because of spacious toe box), but thought I\\'d give these a shot. Besides the \"run small\" evaluation, the toe box is Nike-shaped. Resembles a point rocket\\'s nosecone. Too binding --- they get narrow very quickly forward of the ball of the foot. Extremely hard (almost steel-like) bottom later of sole --- unlike most walkers.', 'While these fit well they did not have much cushioning - much less than what I expect from Asics Gel shoes. The arch support was good, but simply not enough cushioning.', \"Although I ordered and received size 9 D shoes, these were much narrower than any D width shoe I've ever encountered. Have to return them.\", \"After wearing these for a week I find them to be uncomfortable. For reasons unknown the right shoe caused discomfort and pain in my foot. I don't have foot pain normally. I bought these shoes hoping my feet wouldn't be as tired after walking 8 hours plus at theme parks. So far I can't make it through a normal work day. It almost felt that the shoe was forcing my foot to the ride the inner edge of the shoe. I tried 3 types of inserts (gel, memory foam, orthotic) to no avail.\\nMy left foot couldn't be happier. Of course after wearing them they can't be returned. Also, amputation isn't a viable option so it looks like I made an expensive mistake.\\nSize 13 AAA men's foot.\\n\"], 'num_helpful': [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], 'overall': ['5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '3', '3', '3', '2'], 'comfort': ['5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '5', '4', '5', '2', '4', '3', '1'], 'style': ['5', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '3', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '4', '4', '5', '4', '4', '5', '4', '5', '5'], 'size': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '2', '1', '2', '3', '3'], 'width': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '2', '1', '2', '3', '3'], 'arch': ['3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '4', '2', '1', '2', '3', '3']}\n",
